# MontyPython-MarkovMactation

Author: Carson Vandegriffe
Desc: Using a Markov Chain to generate Monty Python Dialogue given scraped movie/tv script data.
Usage: simply run script.py using the command 'py script.py' or, alternatively, 'python3 script.py'

Text-Generation Efficiency Points:
! First word of every sentence, word a, is chosen based on the probability that a often started sentences in the test data.
! Removes duplicates.
! Tracks probability that a certain punctuation mark comes after a word/phrase.
! Necessarily ends text generation on a punctuation mark.
