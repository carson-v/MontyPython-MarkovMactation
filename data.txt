Whoa there!Halt! Who goes there?It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle      of Camelot.  King of the Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign      of all England!Pull the other one!I am.  And this my trusty servant Patsy.      We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights      who will join me in my court of Camelot.  I must speak with your lord      and master.What, ridden on a horse?Yes!You're using coconuts!What?You've got two empty halves of coconut and you're bangin'      'em together.So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this      land, through the kingdom of Mercea, through  Where'd you get the coconut?We found them.Found them?  In Mercea?  The coconut's tropical!What do you mean?Well, this is a temperate zone.The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin      or the plumber may seek warmer climes in winter yet these are not      strangers to our land.Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?Not at all, they could be carried.What    a swallow carrying a coconut?It could grip it by the husk!It's not a question of where he grips it!  It's a simple      question of weight ratios!  A five ounce bird could not carry a 1 pound      coconut.Well, it doesn't matter.  Will you go and tell your master      that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.Listen, in order to maintain air speed velocity, a swallow      needs to beat its wings 43 times every second, right?Please!Am I right?I'm not interested!It could be carried by an African swallow!Oh, yeah, an African swallow maybe, but not         a European swallow. That's my point.Oh, yeah, I agree with that.Will you ask your master if he wants to join my         court at Camelot?!But then of course, uh, African swallows are         non migratory.Oh, yeah.So, they couldn't bring a coconut back         anyway.Wait a minute! Supposing two swallows         carried it together?No, they'd have to have it on a line.Well, simple! They'd just use a strand of         creeper!What, held under the dorsal guiding         feathers?Well, why not?Bring out your dead!Bring out your dead!Bring out your dead!Bring out your dead!Bring out your dead!Bring out your dead!Bring out your dead!Bring out your dead! Nine pence.Bring out your dead!Bring out your dead!Bring out your dead!Here's one.Nine pence.I'm not dead!What?Nothing. Here's your nine pence.I'm not dead!'Ere. He says he's not dead!Yes, he is.I'm not!He isn't?Well, he will be soon. He's very ill.I'm getting better!No, you're not. You'll be stone dead in a moment.Oh, I can't take him like that. It's against         regulations.I don't want to go on the cart!Oh, don't be such a baby.I can't take him.I feel fine!Well, do us a favor.I can't.Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes? He         won't be long.No, I've got to go to the Robinsons'. They've         lost nine today.Well, when's your next round?Thursday.I think I'll go for a walk.You're not fooling anyone, you know. Look. Isn't         there something you can do?Ah, thanks very much.Not at all. See you on Thursday.Right. All right.Who's that, then?I dunno. Must be a king.Why?He hasn't got shit all over him.Old woman!Man!Man. Sorry. What knight lives in that castle over         there?I'm thirty seven.I   what?I'm thirty seven. I'm not old.Well, I can't just call you 'Man'.Well, you could say 'Dennis'.Well, I didn't know you were called 'Dennis'.Well, you didn't bother to find out, did you?I did say 'sorry' about the 'old woman', but from the         behind you looked  What I object to is that you automatically treat me         like an inferior!Well, I am King!Oh, King, eh, very nice. And how d'you get that, eh?         By exploiting the workers! By 'anging on to outdated imperialist dogma         which perpetuates the economic and social differences in our society. If         there's ever going to be any progress with the  Dennis, there's some lovely filth down here. Oh! How         d'you do?How do you do, good lady? I am Arthur, King of the         Britons. Who's castle is that?King of the who?The Britons.Who are the Britons?Well, we all are. We are all Britons, and I am your         king.I didn't know we had a king. I thought we were an         autonomous collective.You're fooling yourself. We're living in a         dictatorship a self perpetuating autocracy in which the working         classes  Oh, there you go bringing class into it again.That's what it's all about. If only people would hear         of  Please! Please, good people. I am in haste. Who lives         in that castle?No one lives there.Then who is your lord?We don't have a lord.What?I told you. We're an anarcho syndicalist commune. We         take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week,Yes.but all the decisions of that officer have to be         ratified at a special bi weekly meetingYes, I see.by a simple majority in the case of purely internal         affairs,Be quiet!but by a two thirds majority in the case of more         major  Be quiet! I order you to be quiet!Order, eh? Who does he think he is? Heh.I am your king!Well, I didn't vote for you.You don't vote for kings.Well, how did you become King, then?The Lady of the Lake,her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur         from the bosom of the water signifying by Divine Providence that I,         Arthur, was to carry Excalibur.That is why I am your king!Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing         swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power         derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic         ceremony.Be quiet!Well, but you can't expect to wield supreme executive         power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!Shut up!I mean, if I went 'round saying I was an emperor just         because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, they'd put me         away!Shut up, will you? Shut up!Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system.Shut up!Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system!         Help! Help! I'm being repressed!Bloody peasant!Oh, what a give away. Did you hear that? Did you hear         that, eh? That's what I'm on about. Did you see him repressing me? You         saw it, didn't you?Aaaagh!Aaagh!Ooh!Aagh!Oh!Ooh! Uuh.Aaaagh!Agh!, oh!, etc.Aaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaah!Umm!You fight with the strength of many men, Sir Knight.I am Arthur, King of the Britons.I seek the finest and the bravest knights in the land to join me in         my court at Camelot.You have proved yourself worthy. Will you join me?You make me sad. So be it. Come, Patsy.None shall pass.What?None shall pass.I have no quarrel with you, good Sir Knight, but I         must cross this bridge.Then you shall die.I command you, as King of the Britons, to stand aside!I move for no man.So be it!Aaah!, hiyaah!, etc.Now stand aside, worthy adversary.'Tis but a scratch.A scratch? Your arm's off!No, it isn't.Well, what's that, then?I've had worse.You liar!Come on, you pansy!Huyah!Hiyaah!Aaaaaaaah!Victory is mine!We thank Thee Lord, that in Thy mer  Hah!Come on, then.What?Have at you!Eh. You are indeed brave, Sir Knight, but the fight is         mine.Oh, had enough, eh?Look, you stupid bastard.

I would be honored.What is your name?'Bedevere', my liege.Then I dub you 'Sir Bedemere, Knight of the Round         Table'.Narrative InterludeThe wise Sir Bedevere was the first to join King         Arthur's knights, but other illustrious names were soon to follow Sir         Lancelot the Brave, Sir Gallahad the Pure, and Sir Robin         the not quite so brave as Sir Lancelot, who had nearly fought the Dragon         of Angnor, who had nearly stood up to the vicious Chicken of Bristol,         and who had personally wet himself at the Battle of Badon Hill, and the         aptly named Sir Not appearing in this film. Together they formed a band         whose names and deeds were to be retold throughout the centuries The         Knights of the Round Table.And that, my liege, is how we know the earth to         be banana shaped.This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere. Explain         again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.Oh, certainly, sir.Look, my liege!Camelot!Camelot!Camelot!It's only a model.Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let         us ride to Camelot!We're Knights of the Round Table. We dance whene'er we're able. We do         routines and chorus scenes With footwork impeccable. We dine well here         in Camelot. We eat ham and jam and spam a lot.We're Knights of the Round Table. Our shows are formidable, But many         times we're given rhymes That are quite unsingable. We're opera mad in         Camelot. We sing from the diaphragm a lot.In war we're tough and able, Quite indefatigable. Between our quests         we sequin vests and impersonate Clark Gable. It's a busy life in         Camelot.I have to push the pram a lot.Well, on second thought, let's not go to Camelot. It         is a silly place.Right. Right.Arthur! Arthur, King of the Britons! Oh, don't grovel!One thing I can't stand, it's people groveling.Sorry.And don't apologize. Every time I try to talk to someone         it's 'sorry this' and 'forgive me that' and 'I'm not worthy'.What are you doing now?!I'm averting my eyes, O Lord.Well, don't. It's like those miserable Psalms   they're         so depressing. Now, knock it off!Yes, Lord.Right!

If he will give us food and shelter for the         night, he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be         very keen.

Sir Robin rode north, through the dark forest of         Ewing, accompanied by his favorite minstrels.Bravely bold Sir Robin rode forth from Camelot. He was not afraid to         die, O brave Sir Robin. He was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty         ways, Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin!He was not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp, Or to         have his eyes gouged out and his elbows broken, To have his kneecaps         split and his body burned away And his limbs all hacked and mangled,         brave Sir Robin!His head smashed in and his heart cut out And his liver removed and         his bowels unplugged And his nostrils raped and his bottom burned off         And his pen  That's   that's, uh   that's enough music for now,         lads.

We are but eight score young blondes and brunettes,         all between sixteen and nineteen and a half, cut off in this castle with         no one to protect us. Oooh.

Come on!Oh, let me have just a little bit of peril?No. It's unhealthy.I bet you're gay.No, I'm not.Narrative InterludeSir Lancelot had saved Sir Galahad from almost         certain temptation, but they were still no nearer the Grail. Meanwhile,         King Arthur and Sir Bedevere, not more than a swallow's flight away, had         discovered something. Oh, that's an unladen swallow's flight, obviously.         I mean, they were more than two laden swallows' flights away   four,         really, if they had a coconut on a line between them. I mean, if the         birds were walking and dragging  Get on with it!Oh, anyway. On to scene twenty four, which is a         smashing scene with some lovely acting, in which Arthur discovers a         vital clue, and in which there aren't any swallows, although I think you         can hear a starling   oooh!Heh, hee ha ha         hee hee!

The Grail is there?There is much danger, for beyond the cave lies the         Gorge of Eternal Peril, which no man has ever crossed.But the Grail! Where is the Grail?!Seek you the Bridge of Death.The Bridge of Death, which leads to the Grail?Heh, hee hee hee hee! Ha ha ha ha ha! Hee ha haNi!Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni!

Other kings said I was         daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same, just to         show 'em. It sank into the swamp. So, I built a second one. That sank         into the swamp. So, I built a third one. That burned down, fell over,         then sank into the swamp, but the fourth one stayed up! And that's         what you're gonna get, lad the strongest castle in these islands.But I don't want any of that. I'd rather  Rather what?!I'd ratherjust sing!Stop that! Stop that!

There is a pestilence upon this land.         Nothing is sacred. Even those who arrange and design shrubberies are         under considerable economic stress at this period in history.Did you say 'shrubberies'?Yes. Shrubberies are my trade. I am a shrubber. My name         is 'Roger the Shrubber'. I arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.Ni!No! No, no, no! No!O Knights of Ni, we have brought you your shrubbery.

We are now the Knights Who Say         'Ecky ecky ecky ecky pikang zoop boing goodem zu owly zhiv'.Ni!Therefore, we must give you a test.What is this test, O Knights of   knights who till         recently said 'ni'?Firstly, you must find another shrubbery!Not another shrubbery!Ni!Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must         place it here beside this shrubbery, only slightly higher so you get the         two level effect with a little path running down the middle.A path! A path! A path! Ni! Shh! Knights of Ni!         Ni! Ni! Shh!

It's good to see you.Now he's said the word!Surely you've not given up your quest for the Holy         Grail?Shut up! No, no.

Narrative InterludeAnd so, Arthur and Bedevere and Sir Robin set out on         their search to find the enchanter of whom the old man had spoken in         scene twenty four. Beyond the forest, they met Lancelot and Galahad, and         there was much rejoicing.Yay! Yay!In the frozen land of Nador, they were forced to eat         Robin's minstrels.And there was much rejoicing.Yay!A year passed.Winter changed into Spring.Mmm, nice.Spring changed into Summer.Oh. Ahh.Summer changed back into Winter,Oh?and Winter gave Spring and Summer a miss and went         straight on into Autumn.Aah.Oh! Waa!Until one dayEh. Oh. See it? Oh. Oh.Knights!

OhTo the north there lies a cave   the cave of Caerbannog           wherein, carved in mystic runes upon the very living rock, the last         words of Olfin Bedwere of Rhegedmake plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.Where could we find this cave, O Tim?Follow. But! Follow only if ye be men of valour, for the         entrance to this cave is guarded by a creature so foul, so cruel that no         man yet has fought with it and lived! Bones of full fifty men lie strewn         about its lair. So, brave knights, if you do doubt your courage or your         strength, come no further, for death awaits you all with nasty, big,         pointy teeth.What an eccentric performance.They're nervous, sire.Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.         Dis mount!Behold the cave of Caerbannog!Right! Keep me covered.What with?W   just keep me covered.Too late!What?There he is!Where?There!What, behind the rabbit?It is the rabbit.You silly sod!What?You got us all worked up!Well, that's no ordinary rabbit!Ohh.That's the most foul, cruel, and bad tempered rodent you         ever set eyes on!You tit!

It's a killer!Get stuffed!He'll do you up a treat, mate.Oh, yeah?You mangy Scots git!I'm warning you!What's he do, nibble your bum?He's got huge, sharp   eh   he can leap about   look at         the bones!Go on, Bors. Chop his head off!Right! Silly little bleeder. One rabbit stew comin'         right up!Look!Aaaugh!Jesus Christ!I warned you!I done it again!I warned you, but did you listen to me? Oh, no, you knew         it all, didn't you? Oh, it's just a harmless little bunny, isn't it?         Well, it's always the same. I always tell them  Oh, shut up!Do they listen to me?Right!Oh, noCharge!Aaaaugh!, Aaaugh!, etc.Run away! Run away!Run away! Run away!Ha ha ha ha! Ha haw haw! Ha! Ha ha!Right. How many did we lose?Gawain.Ector.And Bors. That's five.Three, sir.Three. Three. And we'd better not risk another frontal         assault. That rabbit's dynamite.Would it help to confuse it if we run away more?Oh, shut up and go and change your armor.Let us taunt it! It may become so cross that it will         make a mistake.Like what?Well ooh.Have we got bows?No.We have the Holy Hand Grenade.Yes, of course! The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch! 'Tis         one of the sacred relics Brother Maynard carries with him! Brother         Maynard! Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade!How does it, um   how does it work?I know not, my liege.Consult the Book of Armaments!Armaments, chapter two, verses nine to         twenty one.And Saint Attila raised the hand grenade up on         high, saying, 'O Lord, bless this Thy hand grenade that, with it, Thou         mayest blow Thine enemies to tiny bits in Thy mercy.' And the Lord did         grin, and the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and         anchovies and orangutans and breakfast cereals and fruit bats and large         chu  Skip a bit, Brother.And the Lord spake, saying, 'First shalt thou         take out the Holy Pin. Then, shalt thou count to three. No more. No         less. Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the         counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, nor either count         thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out.         Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then, lobbest         thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being         naughty in My sight, shall snuff it.'Amen.Amen.Right! One! Two! Five!Three, sir!Three!There! Look!What does it say?What language is that?Brother Maynard! You are a scholar.It's Aramaic!Of course! Joseph of Arimathea!'Course!What does it say?It reads, 'Here may be found the last words of Joseph         of Arimathea. He who is valiant and pure of spirit may find the Holy         Grail in the Castle of aaarrrrggh'.What?'The Castle of aaarrrrggh'.What is that?He must have died while carving it.Oh, come on!Well, that's what it says.Look, if he was dying, he wouldn't bother to carve         'aarrggh'. He'd just say it!Well, that's what's carved in the rock!Perhaps he was dictating.Oh, shut up. Well, does it say anything else?No. Just 'aaarrrrggh'.Aaaauugggh.Aarrrggh.Do you suppose he meant the Camaaaaaargue?Where's that?France, I think.Isn't there a 'Saint Aaauuves' in Cornwall?No, that's 'Saint Ives'.Oh, yes. Saint Iiiiives.Iiiiives.Oooohoohohooo!No, no. 'Aaaauugggh', at the back of the throat.         Aaauugh.N   no. No, no, no, no. 'Oooooooh', in surprise and         alarm.Oh, you mean sort of a 'aaaah'!Yes, but I   aaaaaah!Oooh!My God!It's the legendary Black Beast of Aaarrrrggh!That's it! That's it!Run away!Run away!Run away! Run awaaay! Run awaaaaay!Keep running!Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!We've lost him.Aagh!As the horrendous Black Beast lunged forward, escape         for Arthur and his knights seemed hopeless, when suddenly, the animator         suffered a fatal heart attack.Ulk!The cartoon peril was no more. The quest for Holy         Grail could continue.There it is!The Bridge of Death!Oh, great.Look!

Laura, Alfred, Nigel, Annie, Simon,         Amanda,  Wait! I've got something to tell the whole family.Oh, quick. Go and get the others in, Gordon.What could it be? ShhhThe mill's closed! There's no more work. We're destitute.Come in, my little loves. I've got no option but to sell         you all for scientific experiments.No, no. That's the way it is, my loves. Blame the         Catholic church for not letting me wear one of those little rubber         things. Oh, they've done some wonderful things in their time. They         preserved the might and majesty, the mystery of the Church of Rome, and         the sanctity of the sacraments, the indivisible oneness of the Trinity,         but if they'd let me wear one of those little rubber things on the end         of my cock, we wouldn't be in the mess we are now.Couldn't Mummy have worn some sort of pessary?Not if we're going to remain members of the fastest         growing religion in the world, my boy.Ehhh, he's right.Mine!And mine!And mine!So, you see my problem, little ones I can't keep you all         here any longer.Speak up!I can't keep you all here any longer! God has blessed us         so much, I can't afford to feed you anymore.Couldn't you have your balls cut off?Hohh, it's not as simple as that, Nigel. God knows all!         He'd see through such a cheap trick. What we do to ourselves, we do to         Him.You could have had them pulled off in an accident.No. No, children. I know you're trying to help, but,         believe me,Ohhme mind's made up. I've given this long and careful         thought, and it has to be medical experiments for the lot of you.Ohh. Oh. OhLook at them, bloody Catholics, filling         the bloody world up with bloody people they can't afford to bloody feed.What are we dear?Protestant, and fiercely proud of it.Hmm. Well, why do they have so many children?Because every time they have sexual         intercourse, they have to have a baby.But it's the same with us, Harry.What do you mean?Well, I mean, we've got two children, and we've         had sexual intercourse twice.That's not the point. We could have it any time         we wanted.Really?Oh, yes, and, what's more, because we don't         believe in all that Papist claptrap, we can take precautions.What, you mean lock the door?No, no. I mean, because we are members of the         Protestant Reformed Church, which successfully challenged the autocratic         power of the Papacy in the mid sixteenth century, we can wear little         rubber devices to prevent issue.What d'you mean?I could, if I wanted, have sexual intercourse         with you,Oh, yes, Harry.and, by wearing a rubber sheath over my old         feller, I could insure that, when I came off, you would not be         impregnated.Ooh!You what?French Ticklers. Black Mambos. Crocodile Ribs.         Sheaths that are designed not only to protect, but also to enhance the         stimulation of sexual congress.Have you got one?Have I got one? Uh, well, no, but I can go down         the road any time I want and walk into Harry's and hold my head up high         and say in a loud, steady voice, 'Harry, I want you to sell me a condom.         In fact, today, I think I'll have a French Tickler, for I am a         Protestant.'Well, why don't you?But they   Well, they cannot, 'cause their         church never made the great leap out of the Middle Ages and the         domination of alien episcopal supremacy.The Adventures of Martin Luther, an exciting         and controversial examination of the Protestant reformer whose         re assessment of the role of the individual in Christian belief shook         the foundations of a post feudal Germany in the grip of the sixteenth         century. It was a day much like any other in the quiet little town of         Wittenberg. Mamie Meyer was preparing fat for the evening meal when the         full force of the Reformation struck.Mamie! Martin Luther's out!Ohh! Martin Luther! Mmh.Huhh.Did you get the suet, Hymie?Oy veh! The suet I clean forgot. Look out; here he         comes!Girls! Girls!MmhmYour father forgot the suet!Ooohhhh.Ohh.Hello, Martin.H   How   Where's the john?Uh, we don't have one.Hhh! Do you need any cleaning inside?Oh, no. Today it's all going fine.Ahhh. Oh, well, uh, how's about showing me the         cutlery?Martin, I got a woman and children in there.So! There's no problem. I just look at a few spoons,         uh  Well, I got two girls in there, Martin. You know what I         mean.You just want to see the spoons?My life! That's what I want to see!I know I'm going to regret this.Mhhm.Shh!Mamie! Guess who's come to see us?Hymie! Are you out of your mind, already?! You know how         old your daughters are!He   He only wants to see the spoons!Well   Well, what do you have to bring him into my         house for?Mamie, he doesn't think about girls any more.Uh, Mrs. Meyer, as far as girls is concerned, I shot         my wad.You shot your wad?Definitely!Which spoons do you want to view?Oh, I guess the soup spoons.Now they're good spoons!You got 'em arranged?No, but I could arrange them for you.Oh, don't put yourself to no bother, Mrs. Meyer.It's no bother. I want for you to see these spoons like         I would want to see them myself.Hymie! Get him out of here!Mamie! Mamie! He only said for Audrey and Myrtle to         show him the spoons.Like you think I'm running some kind of bordello here?!Mrs. Meyer, how can you say such a thing?Listen, Martin Luther! I know what you want to do with         my girls.Show me the spoons, ehh?You want for them to pull up their skirtsand then lean over a chair with their legs apart.Mamie, don't get excited.I'm getting excited?! It's him that's getting excited!My mind is on the spoons!But you can't stop thinking of those little girls over         the chairs!Oh, oh, I got to go to the bathroom.Hymie, I'm a married woman!So! Just show him the spoons!And you don't want to put nothing up me?Yes, another convert for the Protestants. But         despite Luther's efforts to promote the idea of sex for pleasure,         children multiplied everywhere.The Meaning of Life Part Two Growth and Learning.And spotteth twice they the camels         before the third hour, and so, the Midianites went forth to Ram Gilead         in Kadesh Bilgemath, by Shor Ethra Regalion, to the house of         Gash Bil Bethuel Bazda, he who brought the butter dish to Balshazar and         the tent peg to the house of Rashomon, and there slew they the goats,         yea, and placed they the bits in little pots. Here endeth the lesson.Let us praise God. O Lord,O Lord,ooh, You are so big,ooh, You are so big,so absolutely huge.so absolutely huge.Gosh, we're all really impressed down here, I can         tell You.Gosh, we're all really impressed down here, I         can tell You.Forgive us, O Lord, for this, our dreadful toadying,         andAnd barefaced flattery.But You are so strong and, well, just so super.Fantastic.Amen.Amen.He's coming!Sir?Yes, Wymer?My younger brother's going out with Dibble this         weekend, sir, but I'm not having my hair cut today, sir.So, do I move my clothes down, or  Nnnno, sir.No, sir.No, sir.No.NoNo.Mmmm.

Uhh, was it taking your clothes off, sir?Well, and   and after that?Ooh. Putting them on the lower peg, sir?The purpose of foreplay is to cause the vagina to         lubricate, so that the penis can penetrate more easily.Could we have a window open, please, sir?Oh, sir.Oh, sir.Oh, sirSo, just listen. Now, did I or did I not do         vaginal juices?Mmm. Mmm. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.Name two ways of getting them flowing, Watson.R   rubbing the clitoris, sir?What's wrong with a kiss, boy? Hmm? Why not start         her off with a nice kiss? You don't have to go leaping straight for the         clitoris like a bull at a gate. Give her a kiss, boy.Suck the nipple, sir?Good! Good. Well done, Wymer.Uh, stroking the thighs, sir.Yes. Yes, I suppose so. Hmm?Oh, sir. Biting the neck.Yes. Good. Nibbling the earlobe, uhh, kneading the         buttocks, and so on and so forth. So, we have all these possibilities         before we stampede towards the clitoris, Watson.Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.Oh, sorry, sir. Sorry.Humphrey, I hope you don't mind, but I told         the Garfields we would dine with them tonight.Yes. Yes, well, I suppose we must.And I said we'd be there by eight.Well, at least it'll give me a reason to wind up the         staff meeting.Well, I know you don't like them, but I couldn't make         another excuse.Well, it's just that I felt n   Wymer! This is for         your benefit. Would you kindly wake up? I've no intention of going         through this all again.Ahhh.Uhh, we'll take the foreplay as read, if you don't         mind, dear.No, of course not, Humphrey.So, the man starts by entering   or mounting   his         good lady wife in the standard way. Uh, the penis is now, as you will         observe, more or less, fully erect. There we are. Ah, that's better.         Now,   Carter.Yes, sir?What is it?It's an ocarina, sir.excitement mounts, uh,   What's funny, Biggs?Uh,   Oh, nothing, sir.Oh, do please share your little joke with the rest         of us. I mean, obviously something frightfully funny's going on.No. Honestly, sir.Ohh! Aaaahh!Well done. Okay.Ohh! Uuhh!Right, sir.Oh, hang on a tick, sir.Yeah.You'll never make it, sir.

One         minute it's all 'please' and 'thank you', and the next, they'll kick you         in the teeth!Yeah.Let's not give him the cake.I don't want any cake.Look.

Now, today, we're going to do marching up         and down the square! That is, unless any of you got anything better to         do. Well?! Anyone got anything they'd rather be doing than marching up         and down the square?! Yes?! Atkinson. What would you rather be doing,         Atkinson?Well, to be quite honest, Sarge, I'd rather be at         home with the wife and kids.Would you, now?!Yes, Sarge.Right! Off you go! Now, everybody else happy         with my little plan of marching up and down the square a bit?Sarge!Yes?!I've got a book I'd quite like to read.Right! You go read your book, then! Now!         Everybody else quite content to join in with my little scheme of         marching up and down the square?!Sarge?Yes, Wyclif?! What is it?!Well, I'm, uh, learning the piano.Learning the piano?!Yes, Sarge.And I suppose you want to go and practice, eh?         Marching up and down the square not good enough for you, eh?!Well,  Right! Off you go!Oh.Now! What about the rest of you? Rather be at         the pictures, I suppose.Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Ooh, yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Right.All right! Off you go!Oh. Ooh. Great. That's great. What a day. I want to see         the Merle Oberon picture. Eh hehheh.Bloody army! I don't know what it's coming to.         Right! Sergeant Major, marching up and down the square. Left, right,         left. LeftDemocracy and humanitarianism have always been         trademarks of the British ArmyRubbish!'Scuse me.Morning, Ainsworth.Morning, Pakenham.Sleep well?Not bad. Bit to shreds, though. Must be a hole in         the bloody mosquito net.Excuse me, sir.Yes, Chadwick?I'm afraid Perkins got rather badly bitten during         the night.Well, so did we. Huh.Yes, but I do think doctor ought to see him.Well, go and fetch him, then.Right you are, sir.Suppose I'd better go along. Coming, Pakenham?Yes, I suppose so.Careful!Ah! Morning, Perkins.Morning, sir.What's, uh,   what's all the trouble, then?Bitten, sir. During the night.Hmm. Whole leg gone, eh?Yes.How does it feel?Stings a bit.Mmm. Well, it would, wouldn't it? That's, uh,         quite a bite you've got there, you know.Yes, a real beauty, isn't it?Any idea how it happened?None whatsoever. Complete mystery to me. Woke up just         now, one sock too many.You must have a hell of a hole in your net.Hmm. Well, we've sent for the doctor.Ohh, hardly worth it, isn't it?Oh, yes. Better safe than sorry.Yes. Good Lord, look at this.By jove, that's enormous!You don't think it'll come back, do you?For more, you mean?Yes.You're right. We'd better get this stitched.Right.Ah, hello, doc.Morning! I came as fast as I could. Is,         uhh,   is something up?Yes. Uh, during the night, old Perkins got his leg         bitten sort of off. Mm?Ahh. Been in the wars, have we?Mhm.Yes.Ehh. Any headache? Bowels all right? Mm.         Well, let's have a look at this one leg of yours, then, eh? Yes. Yes.         Yes, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, yes. Yes, well, this is nothing to worry about.Oh, good.Yes, there's a lot of it about. Probably a         virus. Uh, keep warm, plenty of rest, and if you're playing football or         anything, try and favor the other leg.Oh.Mhm.Right o.Be as right as rain in a couple of days.Oh. Thanks for the reassurance, doc.Not at all. That's what I'm here for. Any         other problems I can reassure you about?No, I'm fine.Jolly good. Well, must be off. M hmm.So, it'll, ehh,   it'll just grow back again, then,         will it?Uhh, I think I'd better come clean with         you about this. It's, um,   it's not a virus, I'm afraid. You see, a         virus is what we doctors call very, very small. So small, it could not         possibly have made off with a whole leg. What we're looking for here is,         I think,   And this is no more than an educated guess. I'd like to make         that clear. Is some multi cellular life form with stripes, huge         razor sharp teeth, about eleven foot long, and of the genus Felis         Horribilis what we doctors, in fact, call a 'tiger'.A tiger?!A tiger in Africa?Hm?A tiger in Africa?!W   Ah, well, it, uh,   it has probably escaped         from a zoo. Mhm.Doesn't sound very likely to me.Stumm. Stumm. Stumm.Sir!Stumm.Sir! Sir! Sir! The attack's over, sir! The Zulus are         retreating!Oh, jolly good. Mhm.Quite a lot of casualties, though, sir.M hmm.'C' Division wiped out.Yes.Signals gone.Yes.Thirty men killed in 'F' Section.Yes. I see. Mm.I should think about a hundred   hundred and fifty         men altogether, sir.I haven't got the final figures, sir, but there's a         lot of seriouslyYes.wounded in the compound.Yes. Well, the thing is, Sergeant, I've got a bit         of a problem here. One of the officers has lost a leg.Oh, no, sir!I'm afraid so. Probably a tiger.In Africa?Stumm.Stumm. Stumm. Stumm. The M.O. says we can stitch it         back on if we can find it immediately.Right, sir! I'll organise a party right away,         sir.Well, it's hardly the time for that, is it         Sergeant?Look. A   a search party.Oh! Oh! Ah! Ahh! Much better idea! Mhmm.Oh, sorry about the mess, sir. We'll try and get it         cleared up by the time you get back.We showed 'em, didn't we, sir?Yes.Here, we've got a search party. Leave that alone.This is fun, sir, isn't it? All this killing,         bloodshed   Bloody good fun, sir, isn't it?Yes. Very good.Morning, sir!Agh.Nasty wound you've got there, Potter.Thank you very much, sir!Aghh.Aahh.Come on, Private. We're making up a search party.Better than staying at home, isn't this, sir? Eh? I         mean, at home, if you kill someone, they arrest you. Here, they give you         a gun and show you what to do, sir.Ooh.Hah, mhm mhm mhm.Sorry, sir.Thank you, Sergeant Major.Mm hm.Uhh. Uh, don't shoot. Don't shoot. We're not a         tiger. W   Uhh, we were jus   s   st, um,  Why are you dressed as a tiger?Hm? Oh, 'why'! 'Why'! 'Why'! Haahh, isn't it a         lovely day today?Answer the question.Oh, we were just, um,  Well, uhh, actually, we're   we're dressed like         this because, uh,   Oh. No, that's not it.Uh, we did it for a lark. Part of a spree. High         spirits, you know. Simple as that. Hm.Nothing more to it. Hah.Ha ha.Well, actually, we're on a mission for British         Intelligence. Th   th   there's a pro Tsarist Ashanti Chief, uh,  No, no. No. No, no.Uh, no. No, no, no. No. No. No.No. No, no, no, no. No. No, we're doing it for an         advertisement.Ah, that's it.Mhm.Uhh, forget about the Russians.Mhm.Uh, we're   we're doing an advert for 'Tiger' brand         coffee.'Tiger' brand coffee is a real treat. Even tigers         prefer a cup of it to real meat. Mm.Now look.All right. All right. We are dressed as a tiger         because he had an auntie who did it in eighteen thirty nine, and this is         the fiftieth anniversary.No. We're doing it for a bet.God told us to do it.To tell the truth, we are completely mad.We are   we are inmates of a Bengali psychiatric         institution and we escaped by making this skin out of old, used cereal         packets.Mhm.It doesn't matter!What?It doesn't matter why they're dressed as a tiger.         Have they got my leg?Good thinking! Well, have you?Actually,Yes?it's because we were thinking of training as         taxidermists and we want to get the feel of it from the animal's point         of view.Be quiet. Now look. We're just asking you if you've         got this man's leg.A wooden leg?No, no. A proper leg! Look. He was fast asleep, and         someone or something came in and removed it.Without waking him up?Yes.I don't believe you.We found the tiger skin in a bicycle shop in Cairo.         The owner wanted it taken down to Dar Es Salaam  Shut up! Now look.

They've got to say something.They're bound to.Yeah.Yeah.What do you think the next bit will be, then?Caption, I expect.What? About the next stage of life, you mean? Oh,         yeah.

There you can talk about         the Steelers Bears game this Saturday, or you could, uh, reminisce about         really great World Series.No, no, no, no.What is this one here?Uhh, that's 'philosophy'.Is that a sport?Aah, no, it's more of an attempt to, uh, construct a         viable hypothesis to, uh, explain the meaning of life.What was that?What's he say?What was that?!Shush.Eh?Oh, that sounds wonderful. Would you like to talk         about the meaning of life, darling?Sure. Why not?Philosophy for two?Right.Room?Two five nine.Two five nine.Yup.

Aah, well, uh, see, throughout history,M hmm.there have been certain men and women who have         tried to find the solution to the mysteries of existence,G reat.and we call these guys 'philosophers'!Ohh.And that's what we're talking about.Right!Yeah.Ohh, that's neat!Well, you look like you're getting the idea, so why         don't I give you these, uh, conversation cards?

He's the one that begins with an 'S'.Oh.Umm, like, uh, 'Nietzsche'.Does 'Nietzsche' begin with an 'S'?Uh, there's an 's' in 'Nietzsche'.Oh, wow. Yes, there is. Do all philosophers have         an 's' in them?Uh, yeah! I think most of 'em do.Oh. Does that mean Selina Jones is a philosopher?Yeah! Right! She could be! She sings about the         meaning of life.Yeah. That's right, but I don't think she writes         her own material.No. Oh, maybe Schopenhauer writes her material.No. Burt Bacharach writes it.But there's no 's' in 'Burt Bacharach'.Or in 'Hal David'.Who's Hal David?He writes the lyrics. Burt just writes the tunes,         only now, he's married to Carole Bayer Sager.Oh, waiter. This conversation isn't very good.Oh, I'm sorry, sir! Uhh, we do have one today that's         not on the menu. It's sort of a specialty of the house, you know.Oh, yes.'Live Organ Transplants'.'Live Organ Transplants'? What's that?Yes?Hello. Uhh, can we have your liver?My what?Your liver. It's a large, ehh, glandular organ in your         abdomen.You know, it's, uh,   it's reddish brown.

Eh.No one who has ever had their liver taken out by us has         survived.Agh.Just lie there, sir. It won't take a minute.Zip it up.'Ere. What's going on?Uh, he's donating his liver, madam.Is this because he took out one of those silly         cards?That's right, madam.Typical of him!He goes down to the public library, he sees a few         signs up, comes home all full of good intentions.He gives blood. He does cold research. All that         sort of thing.Oh.Ehh.What do you, uh,   what do you do with them all,         anyway?They all go to saving lives, madam.Mmm. That's what he used to say. 'It's all for the         good of the country' he used to say.Do you think it's all for the good of the country?Hm?Do you think it's all for the good of the country?Well, I wouldn't know about that, madam.

Silly man!I'm too old for that sort of thing. I'm past my         prime.Not at all. You're a very attractive woman.Well, I'm certainly not thinking of getting         hitched up again.Sure?Can we have your liver, then?Oh. No, I'd be scared.Yeah. All right. You talked me into it.Which brings us once again to the urgent         realization of just how much there is still left to own. Item six on the         agenda the meaning of life. Now, uh, Harry, you've had some thoughts on         this.What was that about hats, again?Oh, uh, people aren't wearing enough.Is this true?Certainly. Hat sales have increased, but not pari         passu, as our research initially  But when you say 'enough', enough for what purpose?Ohh.My God!Good Lord!

Voilà.Bon appétit.Thank you, sir, and now, here's ze check.The Meaning of Life Part Six B The Meaning of         Life.M hm hmm. You know, Maria, I sometimes wonder if         we'll ever discover the meaning of it all working in a place like this.Oh, I've worked in worse places, philosophically         speaking.Really, Maria?Yes. I used to work in the Académie Française, but it         didn't do me any good at all,         A   and I once worked in the library in the Prado in Madrid, but it         didn't teach me nothing, I recall,         And the Library of Congress you'd have thought would hold some key,         But it didn't, and neither did the Bodleian Library.         In the British Museum I hoped to find some clue.         I worked there from nine till six, read every volume through,         But it didn't teach me nothing about life's mystery.         I just kept getting older, and it got more difficult to see,         Till, eventually, me eyes went and me arthritis got bad,         And so now I'm cleaning up in here, but I can't be really sad,         'Cause, you see, I feel that life's a game. You sometimes win or lose,                And though I may be down right now, at least I don't work for Jews.Ah! I was saying that   Uh, allo?Come on.Ah, allo?

He's come about the         reaping? I don't think we need any at the moment.Hello. Well, don't leave him hanging around outside,         darling. Ask him in.Darling, I don't think it's quite the moment.Do come in. Come along in. Come and have a drink. Do.

I   I'm afraid we don't         have any beer.The Stilton's awfully good.Good Lord.I am death.Well, isn't that extraordinary? We were just talking         about death only five minutes ago.Yes, we were.Mmm. Mm.You know, whether death is really the end.As my husband, uh, Howard, here, feels, or whether         there is   and one so hates to use words like 'soul' or 'spirit', but  But what other words can one use?E   exactly.You do not understand.Ah, no. Obviously not.Let me just tell you something, Mr. Death.You do n  Just one moment. I'd like to express, on behalf of         everybody here, what a really unique experience this is.Hear, hear.Yes, we're so delighted, uh, that you dropped in, Mr.         Death.Can I just finish, please?Mr. Death, is there an after life?Dear, if you could just wait, please, a moment,  Are you sure you wouldn't like some sherry?Angela. Angela, I'd like to just say this at this         time, if I could, please. Really.Be quiet!Can I just say this at this time, please?Silence! I have come for you.You mean to  Take you away. That is my purpose. I am death.Well, that's cast rather a gloom over the evening,         hasn't it?Shut up! Shut up, you American. You always talk,         you Americans. You talk and you talk and say 'let me tell you something'         and 'I just wanna say this'. Well, you're dead now, so shut up!Dead?Dead.All of us?All of you.Be quiet! Englishmen, you're all so fucking         pompous, and none of you have got any balls.Can I ask you a question?What?The salmon mousse.Darling, you didn't use canned salmon, did you?I'm most dreadfully embarrassed.Just testing. Sorry.Well, the fishmonger promised me he'd have some fresh         salmon, and he's normally so reliable.Stumm. Stumm.Can we keep our glasses?Mmm hmm.Come on.Okay.Hey, I didn't even eat the mousse.Honestly, darling, I'm so embarrassed. It really is         embarrassing.

Why not?I love it here, darling.Me too, Marvin.Hello. Welcome to Heaven. Excuse me, could you         just sign here, please, sir?Yes.Thank you!

It's Christmas every day in         Heaven.Ohh.Mmm.How about that?Hello there.Ah.I love sheep.So do I. Terrific animals. Terrific.No trouble.No, no trouble.Except at shearing. They can play up a bit, then;         can't they?Oh, yeah, but I like that sort of little burst of         frenzy they have then, you know. I like it when they get a little bit         angry. Shows they're human.Oh, yeah. I   I   I'm not saying I dislike them         at shearing, you know, but they can be a bit of a handful; can't they?Well, so would you be if you had a great pair of         scissors snippin' away while someone held your back legs apart.Hm.You'd wiggle a bit. You'd kick up a bit of a fuss.         Heh.Yeah, I   I'm not saying I just expect them to         stand around in the fields and nibble the grass and look a bit pretty.         I   I'm not saying that.Oh, but they are pretty; aren't they?Yeah.Oh, yeah.I mean, look at that one over there against the         sky. The white of the coat, the little black face against the twinkling         stars beyond.Yes. Aww. Terrific.Mhm.Terrific animals.Mm.The little lambs in springtime.Oh.Ahh.The lambs, eh? Now you're talking. They're lovely, eh?         I love them.Oh, so do I, Morris. I love them more than         anything. Little white furry bundles.Mhmm.I think, of all God's creatures, sheep have the best         offspring.Oh, yes. Terrific animals.Mm.Terrific.Yeah. They're so sure footed.Hm.And quick witted.Are they quick witted?Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, they're quite, uh, quick witted.Mhm.Always cheerful. Hmm.Well, except at shearing. Hehhehheh.Why are you always on about shearing?I'm not always on about it, Morris.You are a great deflator, you are.He was  Of all the moments in their little lives, you         unerringly put your finger on the one moment where they lose a little         bit of dignity. Well, I regard that as cheap, quite honestly.Morris, don't get me wrong. I actually like their         behavior at shearing. I actually like them when they get a little bit         cross. I find that endearing.That's the fantastic thing. They're beautiful to look         at, well disposed, quite quick witted, and yet, tough as nails.You know, I can't think of anything I'd rather do         than watch sheep.Mmm.The only other animals that I would be remotely         interested in watching would be cats.They don't have flocks of cats.No, I   I'm not saying they do, Morris.Can you imagine a herds of cats waiting to be sheared?         Meow! Meow! Woo hoo hoo.Shh! Shh.

Come on.Where are you going?Bethlehem.Nowhere! Good night. Uhh.That's right! Leave your sheep! Leave them to the         wolves! Call yourselves shepherds?! You're a disgrace to the profession!Huh. What a rotten thing to do,Yeah.to go and leave those little helpless furry         bundles alone on the hillside.So they can go down to Bethlehem and get drunk.Is it A.D. yet?Quarter past.Ahem.Ohhh!Who are you?We are three wise men.What?!We are three wise men.Well, what are you doing creeping around a cow shed at         two o'clock in the morning?

Yes, I see.Oh, come on, Brian, or they'll have stoned him before         we get there.All right.Hey. Get off her. That's disgusting. Stop trying         to do that. Hey, officer, intervene here.

Not so much as a by your         leave. 'You're cured mate.' Bloody do gooder.Well, why don't you go and tell him you want to be a         leper again?Ah, yeah. I could do that, sir. Yeah. Yeah, I could         do that, I suppose. What I was thinking was, I was going to ask him if         he could make me a bit lame in one leg during the middle of the week.         You know, something beggable, but not leprosy, which is a pain in the         arse, to be blunt. Excuse my French, sir, but, uh  Brian! Come and clean your room out.There you are.Thank you, sir.

Promised me the         known world he did. I was to be taken to Rome, House by the Forum.         Slaves. Asses' milk. As much gold as I could eat. Then, he, having his         way with me had voom! Like a rat out of an aqueduct.The bastard!Yeah. So, next time you go on about the 'bloody         Romans', don't forget you're one of them.I'm not a Roman, Mum, and I never will be! I'm a Kike!         A Yid! A Hebe! A Hook nose! I'm Kosher, Mum! I'm a Red Sea Pedestrian,         and proud of it!Huh. Sex, sex, sex. That's all they think about, huh?         Well, how are you, then, officer?Ladies and gentlemen. The next contest is         between Frank Goliath, the Macedonian baby crusher, and Boris         Mineburg.Want someThank you, fellows.Larks' tongues. Wrens' livers. Chaffinch brains.         Jaguars' earlobes. Wolf nipple chips. Get 'em while they're hot. They're         lovely. Dromedary pretzels, only half a denar. Tuscany fried bats.I do feel, Reg, that any Anti Imperialist group like         ours must reflect such a divergence of interests within its power base.Agreed. Francis?Yeah. I think Judith's point of view is very valid,         Reg, provided the Movement never forgets that it is the inalienable         right of every man  Or woman.Or woman to rid himself  Or herself.Or herself.Agreed.Thank you, brother.Or sister.Or sister. Where was I?I think you'd finished.Oh. Right.Furthermore, it is the birthright of every man  Or woman.Why don't you shut up about women, Stan.

From now on, I want you all to         call me 'Loretta'.What?!It's my right as a man.Well, why do you want to be Loretta, Stan?I want to have babies.You want to have babies?!It's every man's right to have babies if he wants         them.But you can't have babies.Don't you oppress me.I'm not oppressing you, Stan. You haven't got a womb!         Where's the foetus going to gestate?! You going to keep it in a box?!Here! I   I've got an idea. Suppose you agree that he         can't actually have babies, not having a womb, which is nobody's fault,         not even the Romans', but that he can have the right to have babies.Good idea, Judith. We shall fight the oppressors for         your right to have babies, brother. Sister. Sorry.What's the point?What?What's the point of fighting for his right to have babies         when he can't have babies?!It is symbolic of our struggle against oppression.Symbolic of his struggle against reality.Get out there.It's, um  Get out there.It's dangerous out there. Ah ah. Ah! Oh.Ooh.Aaah. OhhWhat a load of rubbish.Larks' tongues. Otters' noses. Ocelot spleens.Got any nuts?I haven't got any nuts. Sorry.

If you wanted to join the P.F.J., you'd have to         really hate the Romans.I do!Oh, yeah? How much?A lot!Right. You're in. Listen. The only people we hate more         than the Romans are the fucking Judean People's Front.YeahSplitters.SplittersAnd the Judean Popular People's Front.Yeah. Oh, yeah. Splitters.

Brian Cohen.We may have a little job for you, Brian.What's this, then? 'Romanes Eunt Domus'? 'People         called Romanes they go the house'?It   it says, 'Romans, go home'.No, it doesn't. What's Latin for 'Roman'? Come on!Aah!Come on!'R   Romanus'?Goes like?'Annus'?Vocative plural of 'annus' is?Eh. 'Anni'?'Romani'. 'Eunt'? What is 'eunt'?'Go'. Let  Conjugate the verb 'to go'.Uh. 'Ire'. Uh, 'eo'. 'Is'. 'It'. 'Imus'. 'Itis'.         'Eunt'.So 'eunt' is?Ah, huh, third person plural, uh, present indicative.         Uh, 'they go'.But 'Romans, go home' is an order, so you must use         the?The imperative!Which is?Umm! Oh. Oh. Um, 'i'. 'I'!How many Romans?Ah! 'I'   Plural. Plural. 'Ite'. 'Ite'.'Ite'.Ah. Eh.'Domus'?Eh.Nominative?Oh.'Go home'? This is motion towards. Isn't it, boy?Ah. Ah, dative, sir! Ahh! No, not dative! Not the         dative, sir! No! Ah! Oh, the accusative! Accusative! Ah! 'Domum',         sir! 'Ad domum'! Ah! Oooh! Ah!Except that 'domus' takes the?The locative, sir!Which is?!'Domum'.'Domum'.Aaah! Ah.'Um'. Understand?Yes, sir.Now, write it out a hundred times.Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Hail Caesar, sir.Hail Caesar. If it's not done by sunrise, I'll cut         your balls off.Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Hail Caesar and         everything, sir! Oh. Mmm!Finished!Right. Now don't do it again.Hey! Bloody Romans.We're gettin' in through the underground heating         system here, up through into the main audience chamber here, and         Pilate's wife's bedroom is here. Having grabbed his wife, we inform         Pilate that she is in our custody and forthwith issue our demands. Any         questions?What exactly are the demands?We're giving Pilate two days to dismantle the entire         apparatus of the Roman Imperialist State, and if he doesn't agree         immediately, we execute her.Cut her head off?Cut all her bits off. Send 'em back on the hour every         hour. Show them we're not to be trifled with.Also, we're demanding a ten foot mahogany statue of the         Emperor Julius Caesar with his dock hangin' out.What? They'll never agree to that, Reg.That's just a bar   a bargaining counter. And of course,         we point out that they bear full responsibility when we chop her up, and         that we shall not submit to blackmail!No blackmail!They've bled us white, the bastards. They've taken         everything we had, and not just from us, from our fathers, and from our         fathers' fathers.And from our fathers' fathers' fathers.Yeah.And from our fathers' fathers' fathers' fathers.Yeah. All right, Stan. Don't labour the point. And what         have they ever given us in return?!The aqueduct?What?The aqueduct.Oh. Yeah, yeah. They did give us that. Uh, that's true.         Yeah.And the sanitation.Oh, yeah, the sanitation, Reg. Remember what the city         used to be like?Yeah. All right. I'll grant you the aqueduct and the         sanitation are two things that the Romans have done.And the roads.Well, yeah. Obviously the roads. I mean, the roads go         without saying, don't they? But apart from the sanitation, the aqueduct,         and the roads  Irrigation.Medicine.Huh? Heh? HuhEducation.OhhYeah, yeah. All right. Fair enough.And the wine.Oh, yes. YeahYeah. Yeah, that's something we'd really miss, Reg,         if the Romans left. Huh.Public baths.And it's safe to walk in the streets at night now,         Reg.Yeah, they certainly know how to keep order. Let's         face it. They're the only ones who could in a place like this.Hehh, heh. Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh.All right, but apart from the sanitation, the medicine,         education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, a fresh water system,         and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us?Brought peace.Oh. Peace? Shut up!I am a poor man. My sight is poor. My legs are old         and bent, and  It's all right, Matthias.It's all clear.Well, where's Reg?Oh, Reg. Reg, it's Judith.What went wrong?The first blow has been struck!Did he finish the slogan?A hundred times, in letters ten foot high, all the way         around the palace!Oh, great. Great. We   we need doers in our movement,         Brian, but, before you join us, know this. There is not one of us here         who would not gladly suffer death to rid this country of the Romans once         and for all.Uhh. Well, one.Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's one, but otherwise, we're solid.         Are you with us?Yes!From now on, you shall be called 'Brian that is called         Brian'. Tell him about the raid on Pilate's palace, Francis.Right. This is the planNow, this is the palace in Caesar's Square. Our         commando unit will approach from Fish Street, under cover of night, and         make our way to the northwestern main drain. If questioned, we are         sewage workers on our way to a conference. Reg, our glorious leader and         founder of the P.F.J., will be coordinating consultant at the drain         head, though he himself will not be taking part in any terrorist action,         as he has a bad back.Aren't you going to come with us?Solidarity, brother.Oh, yes. Solidarity, Reg.Once in the sewer, timing will be of the essence.         There is a Roman feast later in the evening, so we must move fast, and         don't wear your best sandals. Turning left here, we enter the         Caesar Augustus memorial sewer and from there, proceed directly to the         hypocaust. This has just been re tiled, so terrorists, careful with         those weapons. We will now be directly beneath Pilate's audience chamber         itself. This is the moment for Habbakuk to get out his prong.Shhh! Shh. Shhh. Shh.Campaign for Free Galilee.Oh. Uh, People's Front of Judea. Officials.Oh.What's your group doing here?We're going to kidnap Pilate's wife, take her         back, issue demands.So are we.What?That's our plan!We were here first!What do you mean?!We thought of it first!Oh, yeah?Yes, a couple of years ago!Ha. Heh. Ha ha.We did!Okay, c   co   come on. You got all your demands         worked out, then?'Course we have.What are they?Well, I'm not telling you.AghhhOh, come on. Pull the other one.Shh!That's not the point! We thought of it before         you!Did not.We did!You didn't.We bloody did!Shhhh!Shhhhh! Shh.You bastards!

Ohh.We mustn't fight each other! Surely we should be united         against the common enemy!The Judean People's Front?!No, no! The Romans!Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes.Yeah. He's right. Let's go in, get her out, and we         can argue afterwards.All right.Yeah.Promise.Yeah.Solidarity!Solidarity.Solidarity.Ahh.Let's go get her.Oh. Oh! Oh! Ohhh! Aaahh! Waahh! OohI got her.

You saw him spit in my face!Ohh! What wouldn't I give to be spat at in the face! I         sometimes hang awake at night dreaming of being spat at in the face.Well, it's not exactly friendly, is it? They had me in         manacles!Manacles! Ooh oooh oh oh. My idea of heaven is to be         allowed to be put in manacles just for a few hours. They must think         the sun shines out o' your arse, sonny.Oh, lay off me. I've had a hard time!You've had a hard time?! I've been here five years! They         only hung me the right way up yesterday! So, don't you come 'rou  All right. All right.They must think you're Lord God Almighty.What will they do to me?Oh, you'll probably get away with crucifixion.Crucifixion?!Yeah, first offence.Get away with crucifixion?! It's  Best thing the Romans ever did for us.What?!Oh, yeah. If we didn't have crucifixion, this country         would be in a right bloody mess.Guards!Nail him up, I say!Guards!Nail some sense into him!I want you to move me to another cell.Aah!Oh, look at that! Bloody favoritism!Shut up, you!Sorry!Now, take my case. They hung me up here five years ago.         Every night, they take me down for twenty minutes, then they hang me up         again, which I regard as very fair, in view of what I done, and, if         nothing else, it's taught me to respect the Romans, and it's taught         me that you'll never get anywhere in this life, unless you're         prepared to do a fair day's work for a fair day's pay!Oh, shut up!Ehhh.Pilate wants to see you!Me?Come on!Pilate? What does he want to see me for?I think he wants to know which way up you want to         be crucified.Oh, ha ha ha haa! Ha haa! Nice one, Centurion. Like it.         Like it.Shut up!Right. Right.

Your family arrived, then?Reg!Hello, sibling Brian.Thank God you've come, Reg.Ahh, yes. Well, I think I should point out first, Brian,         in all fairness, that we are not in fact the rescue committee. However,         I have been asked to read the following prepared statement on behalf of         the Movement. Uh, 'We, the People's Front of Judea, brackets, officials,         end brackets, do hereby convey our sincere fraternal and sisterly         greetings to you, Brian, on this, the occasion of your martyrdom.'What?'Your death will stand as a landmark in the continuing         struggle to liberate the parent land from the hands of the Roman         Imperialist aggressors, excluding those concerned with drainage,         medicine, roads, housing, education, viniculture, and any other Romans         contributing to the welfare of Jews of both sexes and hermaphrodites.         Signed on behalf of the P.F.J., etcetera.' And I'd just like to add, on         a personal note, my own admiration for what you are doing for us, Brian,         at what must be, after all, for you, a very difficult time.Reg! Well, what are you going to do?Good bye, Brian, and thanks.Well done, Brian. Keep it up, lad.Terrific work, Brian.Yeah. Right. AndAnd so say all of  You bastards! You bastards!Where is Brian of Nazareth?!You sanctimonious bastards!I have an order for his release!You stupid bastards!Uh, I'm Brian of Nazareth.What?!Yeah, I   I   I'm Brian of Nazareth.Take him down!I'm Brian of Nazareth!Eh, I'm Brian!I'm Brian!Look, I'm Brian!I'm Brian!I'm Brian!I'm Brian, and so's my wife!I'm Brian!

Oooh.You silly sods.Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian!Judith!So, there you are! I might have known it would end up         like this. To think of all the love and affection I've wasted on you.         Well, if that's how you treat your poor old mother in the autumn years         of her life, all I can say is, 'Go ahead. Be crucified. See if I care.'         I might have known it wouldMum!end up like this. Sex, sex. That'sMum!all young people are interested in nowadays. I don't         know what the world's coming to.Cheer up, Brian. You know what they say. Some         things in life are bad. They can really make you mad. Other things just         make you swear and curse. When you're chewing on life's gristle, Don't         grumble. Give a whistle. And this'll help things turn out for the best.         AndIf life seems jolly rotten, There's something you've forgotten, And         that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing. When you're feeling in the         dumps, Don't be silly chumps. Just purse your lips and whistle. That's         the thing. AndAlways look on the bright side of life.Come on!For life is quite absurd And death's the final         word. You must always face the curtain with a bow. Forget about your         sin. Give the audience a grin.Enjoy it. It's your last         chance, anyhow. So,Life's a piece of shit, When you look at it.         Life's a laugh and death's a joke. It's true. You'll see it's all a         show. Keep 'em laughing as you go. Just remember that the last laugh is         on you. AndCome on, Brian. Cheer up.Worse things happen at sea, you know.Always look on the bright side of life!I mean, what you got to lose? You know, you come from nothing.You're going back to nothing. What have you lost? Nothing!Nothing will come from nothing. You know what they say?Always look on the bright side of life!Cheer up, you old bugger. Come on. Give us a grin. There you are. See?It's the end of the film. Incidentally, this record's available in the foyer.Always look on the bright side of life!Some of us have got to live as well, you know.Who do you think pays for all this rubbish?Always look on the bright side of life!They'll never make their money back, you know. I told him.I said to him, 'Bernie.' I said, 'They'll never make their money back.'That should give you enough.Hello again, and welcome to the show. Tonight we             continue to look at some famous deaths. Tonight we start with the             wonderful death of Genghis Khan, conqueror of India.

Back to you, Wolfgang.Strewth!Oh blimey, how time flies. Sadly we are reaching             the end of yet another program and so it is finale time. We are             proud to be bringing to you one of the evergreen bucket kickers.             Yes, the wonderful death of the famous English Admiral Nelson.Kiss me Hardy!Ah   good evening everyone, and welcome to the             second of our Italian language classes, in which we'll be helping             you brush up your Italian. Last week we started at the beginning,             and we learnt the Italian for a 'spoon'. Now, I wonder how many of             you can remember what it was?Not all at once  sit down Mario. Giuseppe!II cucchiaio.Well done Giuseppe, or, as the Italians would             say 'Molto bene, Giuseppe'.Grazie signor  grazie di tutta la sua             gentilezza.Well, now, this week we're going to learn some             useful phrases to help us open a conversation with an Italian. Now             first of all try telling him where you come from. For example, I             would say 'Sono Inglese di Gerrard's Cross', I am an Englishman             from Gerrard's Cross. Shall we all try that together?Sono Inglese di Gerrard's Cross.Not too bad, now let's try it with somebody else.             Er Mr ?Mariolini.Ah, Mr. Mariolini, and where are you from?Napoli, signor.Ah  you're an Italian.Si, si signor!Well in that case you would say 'Sono Italiano             di Napoli'.Ah, capisco, mile grazie signorPer favore, signor!Yes?Non conosgeve parliamente, signor devo me parlo             sono Italiano di Napoli quando il habitare de Milano.I'm sorry  I don't understand!Bitte mein Herr. Was ist das Won für Mittelschmerz?Ah! Helmut   you want the German classes.My friend he say, 'Why must I say I am Italian             from Napoli when he lives in Milan?'Ah, I well, tell your friend  if he lives             in Milan he must say 'Sono Italiano di Milano'He say 'Milan is better than Napoil'.Oh, he shouldn't be saying that, we haven't done             comparatives yet.during an animation Yes, mothers,             new improved Whizzo butter containing 10% more or less is absolutely             indistinguishable from a dead crab. Remember, buy Whizzo butter and             go to HEAVEN!I can't tell the difference             between Whizzo butter and this dead crab.Yes, you know, we find that nine             out of ten British housewives can't tell the difference between             Whizzo butter and a dead crab.It's true, we can't. No.Here. Here! You're on             television, aren't you?He does the thing with one of             those silly women who can't tell Whizzo butter from a dead crab.You try that around here, young             man, and we'll slit your face.Good evening and welcome to another edition of             It's the Arts. And we kick off this evening with Cinema.Good evening. One of the most prolific film             directors of this age, or indeed of any age, is Sir Edward Ross,             back in his native country for the first time for five years to open             a season of his works at the National Film Theatre, and we are             indeed fortunate to have him with us in this studio tonight.Good evening.Edward you don't mind if I call you Edward?No, not at all.Because it does worry some people   I don't know why               but they are a little sensitive so I take the precaution of asking             on these occasions.No, that's fine.So Edward's all right. Splendid. I'm sorry to have             brought it up.No, no, please. Edward it is.Well thank you very much for being so helpful. And             it's more than my job's worth to, erYes, quite.Makes it rather difficult to establish a rapport               put the other person at his easeQuite.Silly little point but it does seem to matter.             Still, er, least said the better. Ted, when you first started you             I hope you don't mind if I call you Ted, er, I mean as opposed to             Edward?No, no, everyone calls me Ted.Well of course it's shorter, isn't it.Yes it is.And much less formal!Yes, Ted, Edward or anything!Thank you. Um, incidentally, do call me Tom. I don't             want you bothering with this 'Thomas' nonsense! Ha ha ha ha! Now             where were we? Ah yes. Eddie Baby, when you first started in theI'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I don't like being called             Eddie Baby.What?I don't like being called Eddie Baby.Yes, you did! Now if you could get on with the             interviewI don't think I did call you Eddie Baby.You did!Did I call him Eddie Baby?I didn't really call you Eddie Baby, did I,             sweetie?Don't call me sweetie!Can I call you sugar plum?No.Pussycat?No!Angel drawers?No you may not! Get on with it!Can I call you Frank?It's a nice name. Richard Nixon's got a hedgehog             called Frank.What IS going on?Now Frank    Fran    Frannie    little             Frannie poohTell us about your latest film, Sir Edward, if you'd             be so very kind.None of this Pussycat nonsense?My latest film?Yes, Sir Edward.Well the idea, funnily enough, is based on an idea I             had when I first joined the industry in 1919. Of course, in those             days I was only the tea boy andOh shut up!Last week the Royal Festival Hall saw the             first performance of a new symphony by one of the world's leading             modern composers, Arthur 'Two sheds' Jackson. Mr. Jackson.Hello.May I just sidetrack for             one moment. This    what shall I call it    nickname of yoursAh yes.Two sheds. How did you come by it?Well, I don't use it myself, but some             of my friends call me Two Sheds.And do you in fact have two sheds?No, I've only got one. I've had one for             some time, but a few years ago I said I was thinking of getting             another, and since then some people have called me Two Sheds.In spite of the fact that you only have             one.Yes.And are you still intending to purchase             this second shed?To bring you in line with your epithet?No.I see, I see. Well to return to your             symphony.Ah yes.Did you write this symphony in the shed?Have you written any of your recent works             in this shed of yours?No, no, not at all. It's just an             ordinary garden shed.I see, I see. And you're thinking of             buying this second shed to write in!No, no. Look. This shed business    it             doesn't really matter. The sheds aren't important. A few friends             call me Two Sheds and that's all there is to it. I wish you'd ask me             about the music. Everybody talks about the sheds. They've got it out             of proportion    I'm a composer. I'm going to get rid of the shed.             I'm fed up with it!Then you'll be Arthur 'No Sheds' Jackson,             eh?Look, forget about the sheds. They             don't matter.Huh!I understand that you used to be             interested in train spotting.What?I understand that, about thirty years ago,             you were interested in train spotting.Well what's that got to do with my             bloody music?Yes, a little. Good Lord! You're the man             who interviewed Sir Edward Ross earlier.Exactly. Well we interviewers are             more than a match for the likes of you, Two Sheds.Here, what are you doing? Stop it!             [Crash.]Get your own Arts program, you             fairy!Arthur Two Sheds Jackson Never mind,             Timmy.Oh Mike, you're such a comfort.And now for more news of the momentous artistic             event in which Pablo Picasso is doing a specially commissioned             painting for us whilst riding a bicycle. Pablo Picasso   the founder             of modern art   without doubt the greatest abstract painter ever             for the first time painting in motion. But first of all let's have a             look at the route he'll be taking.Well Picasso will be starting, David, at             Chichester here, he'll then cycle on the A29 to Fontwell, he'll then             take the A272 which will bring him on to the A3 just north of             Hindhead here. From then on Pablo has a straight run on the A3 until             he meets the South Circular at Battersea here. Well, this is a truly             remarkable occasion as it is the first time that a modern artist of             such stature has taken the A272, and it'll be very interesting to             see how he copes with the heavy traffic round Wisborough Green.             Vicky.Well Picasso will be riding his Viking Super             Roadster with the drop handlebars and the dual thread wheel rims and             with his Wiley Prat 20 1 synchro mesh he should experience             difficulties on the sort of road surfaces they just don't get             abroad. Mitzie.And now for the latest report on Picasso's             progress over to Reg Moss on the Guildford by pass.Well there's no sign of Picasso at the moment, David.             But he should be through here at any moment. However I do have Geppo             with me, Mr. Ron Geppo, British Cycling Sprint Champion and this             year's winner of the Derby Doncaster rally.Well, thank you Ron. Well, there still seems to be no             sign of Picasso, so I'll hand you back to the studio.Well, we've just heard that Picasso is             approaching the Tolworth roundabout on the A3 so come in Sam Trench             at Tolworth.That's not Picasso   that's Kandinsky.He's German!But as yet absolutely no sign of Pablo Picasso,             and so from Tolworth roundabout back to the studio.This man is Ernest Scribbler writer of             jokes. In a few moments, he will have written the funniest joke in             the world and, as a consequence, he will die  laughing.It was obvious that this joke was lethal no             one could read it and live This morning, shortly after eleven o'clock,             comedy struck this little house in Dibley Road. Sudden violent              comedy. Police have sealed off the area, and Scotland Yard's             crack inspector is with me now.I shall enter the house and attempt to remove             the joke.There goes a brave man. Whether he comes out             alive or not, this will surely be remembered as one of the most             courageous and gallant acts in police history.It was not long before the Army became             interested in the military potential of the Killer Joke. Under top             security, the joke was hurried to a meeting of Allied Commanders at             the Ministry of War.Top brass were impressed. Tests on Salisbury             Plain confirmed the joke's devastating effectiveness at a range of             up to fifty yards.Fantastic.All through the winter of '43 we had translators             working, in joke proof conditions, to try and produce a German             version of the joke. They worked on one word each for greater             safety. One of them saw two words of the joke and spent several             weeks in hospital· But apart from that things went pretty quickly,             and we soon had the joke by January, in a form which our troops             couldn't understand but which the Germans could.So, on July 8th, I944, the joke was first told             to the enemy in the ArdennesTell the  joke.In action it was deadly.Wenn ist das Nunstrück git und Slotermeyer?                 Ja! .. Beiherhund das Oder die Flipperwaldt gersput!The German casualties were appalling.Vott is the big joke?I can only give you name, rank, and why did                 the chicken cross the road?All right. How do you make a Nazi cross?I can stand physical pain, you know.Ah you're no fun. All right, Otto.Oh no   anything but that please no, all                 right I'll tell you.Quick Otto. The typewriter.Wenn ist das Nunstrück git und Slotermeyer?                 Ja! Beiherhund das Oder die Flipperwaldt gersput.Ach! Zat iss not funny!But at Peenemunde in the Autumn of '44,                 the Germans were working on a joke of their own.Die ist ein Kinnerhunder und zwei Mackel                 über und der bitte schön ist den Wunderhaus sprechensie. 'Nein'                 sprecht der Herren 'Ist aufern borger mit zveitingen'.We let you know.But by December their joke was ready, and                 Hitler gave the order for the German V Joke to be broadcast in                 English.In 1945 Peace broke out. It                 was the end of the Joke. Joke warfare was banned at a special                 session of the Geneva Convention, and in 1950 the last remaining                 copy of the joke was laid to rest here in the Berkshire                 countryside, never to be told again.Good afternoon.AfternoonAh, lovely day isn't it?Eh, 'tis that.You here on holiday?Nope, I live 'ere.Oh, good for you. Uhthose ARE sheep             aren't they?Yeh.Hmm, thought they were.

It's my belief that these             sheep are laborin' under the misapprehension that they're birds.             Observe their be'avior. Take for a start the sheeps' tendency to 'op             about the field on their 'ind legs. Now witness their attempts to fly             from tree to tree. Notice that they do not so much fly asplummet.Yes, but why do they think they're             birds?But where did they get the idea?From Harold. He's that most dangerous             of creatures, a clever sheep. 'e's realized that a sheep's life             consists of standin' around for a few months and then bein' eaten.             And that's a depressing prospect for an ambitious sheep.Well why don't you just remove Harold?Because of the enormous commercial             possibilities if 'e succeeds.And what exactly are the commercial             possibilities of ovine aviation?Continued in the Sketch French lecture on Sheep AircraftJOHN Bonsoir   ici nous avons             les diagrammes modernes d'un mouton anglo français  maintenant              baa aa, baa aa nous avons, dans la tête, le cabinc.

And opposite             him we have Dr Tom Jack humanist, broadcaster, lecturer and author             of the book 'Hello Sailor'. Tonight, instead of discussing the             existence or non existence of God, they have decided to fight for             it. The existence, or non existence, to be determined by two falls,             two submissions, or a knockout. All right boys, let's get to it.

Well .. there we are leaving the Epilogue for the             moment, we'll be bringing you the result of this discussion later on             in the program.Yes. The Mouse Problem· This week 'The World             Around Us' looks at the growing social phenomenon of Mice and Men.             What makes a man want to be a mouse.And when did you first notice these shall             we say tendencies?Well I was about seventeen and some mates             and me went to a party, and, er we had quite a lot to drink             and then some of the fellows there  started handing  cheese             around  and well just out of curiosity 1 tried a bit  and well             that was that.And what else did these fellows do?Well some of them started dressing up as mice a             bit  and then when they'd got the costumes on they started              squeaking.Yes. And was that all?That was all.And what was your reaction to this?Well I was shocked. But, er gradually I came             to feel that I was more at ease  with other mice.A typical case, whom we shall refer to as Mr. A,             although his real name is thisWhat is it that attracts someone like Mr. A to             this way of life? I have with me a consultant psychiatrist.Well, we've just heard a typical case history. I             myself have over seven hundred similar histories, all fully             documented. Would you care to choose one? what makes certain men want to be mice?And, of course, Hillaire Belloc. But what is the             attitude of the man in the street towards this growing social problem?Clamp down on them.How?I'd strangle them.Well speaking as a member of the Stock             Exchange I would suck their brains out with a straw, sell the widows             and orphans and go into South American Zinc.Yean I'd, er, stuff sparrows down their throats, er,             until the beaks stuck out through the, er, stomach walls.Oh well I'm a chartered accountant, and             consequently too boring to be of interest.I feel that these poor unfortunate people should be             free to live the lives of their own choice.I'd split their nostrils open with a boat hook, I             think.Well I mean, they can't help it, can they? But,             er, there's nothing you can do about it. So er, I'd kill 'em.Clearly the British public's view is a hostile             one.But perhaps this is because so little is             generally known of these mice men. We have some film now taken of             one of the notorious weekend mouse parties, where these disgusting             little perverts meet.Mr. A tells us what actually goes on at these             mouse parties.Well first of all you get shown to your own private             hole in the skirting board then you put the mouse skin on then             you scurry into the main room, and perhaps take a run in the wheel.The remainder of this film was taken secretly at             one of these mouse parties by a BBC cameraman posing as a vole. As             usual we apologize for the poor quality of the film.Well, er, then you steal some cheese, Brie             or Camembert, or Cheddar or Gouda, if you're on the harder stuff.             You might go and see one of the blue cheese films there's a big             clock in the middle of the room, and about 12.50 you climb up it and             then eventually, it strikes one and you all run down.And what's that?That's the farmer's wife.Perhaps we need to know more of these mice men             before we can really judge them. Perhaps not. Anyway, our thirty             minutes are up.Goodnight.Mr. Larch, you heard the case for the prosecution.             Is there anything you wish to say before I pass sentence?It's only a bloody parking offence.I'm sorry I'm late m'lud I couldn't find a kosher             car park.

Er, well, er, virtually, m'lud.He's not completely dead?No he's not completely dead m'lud. No. But he's             not at all well.But if he's not dead, what's he doing in a coffin?What was that knock?Where is all this leading us?What do you mean, no further questions? You can't             just dump a dead body in my court and say 'no further questions'. I             demand an explanation.There are no easy answers in this case m'lud.I think you haven't got the slightest idea what             this case is about.M'lud the strange, damnable, almost diabolic             threads of this extraordinary tangled web of intrigue will shortly             m'lud reveal a plot so fiendish, so infernal, so heinousMr. Bartlett, your client has already pleaded             guilty to the parking offence.Parking offence, schmarking offence, m'lud.

London is so beautiful at this             time of year.Er, you are Cardinal Armand du Piessis de             Richelieu, First Minister of Louis XIII?Oui.Cardinal, would it be fair to say that you not             only built up the centralized monarchy in France but also             perpetuated the religious schism in Europe?Did you persecute the Huguenots?Oui.And did you take even sterner measures against             the great Catholic nobles who made common cause with foreign foes in             defense of their feudal independence?I sure did that thing.Cardinal. Are you acquainted with the defendant,             Harold Latch?Since I was so high indicated how high.Speaking as a Cardinal of the Roman Catholic             Church, as First Minister of Louis XIII, and as one of the             architects of the modern world already   would you say that Harold             Larch was a man of good character?Listen. Harry is a very wonderful human being.M'lud. In view of the impeccable nature of this             character witness may I plead for clemency?Oh but it's only thirty shillings.Not so fast!Why not?Yes, and I've a few questions I'd like to             ask Cardinal so called Richelieu.Bonjour Monsieur Dim.So called Cardinal, I put it to you that             you died in December 1642.That is correct.Ah ha!

First of all you force             him to drop the banana; then, second, you eat the banana, thus             disarming him.

Forethought.Well how many 16 ton weights are there?Look, look, look, Mr. Knowall. The 16 ton weight             is just _one way_ of dealing with a raspberry killer.

Now the first thing to do when you're being stalked by an ugly mob             with redcurrants is to    release the tiger!The great advantage of the tiger in unarmed             combat is that he eats not only the fruit laden foe but also the             redcurrants. Tigers however do not relish the peach. The peach             assailant should be attacked with a crocodile. Right, now, the rest             of you, where are you?

What are you trying to say, Larry?Couldn't we just steal the watch, BossOh, you dumb cluck! We spent weeks organizing this             job. Reg rented a room across the road and filmed the people going             in and out every day. Vic spent three weeks looking at watch             cataloguesuntil he knew the price of each one backwards, and now             I'm not going to risk the whole raid just for the sake of breaking             the law.Urr couldn't we park on a double yellow line?No!Couldn't we get a dog to foul the footNo!What's the matter with you?I just thought I left the car on a meter and             it'sOverdue?Yes, Boss.How much?Five minutes overdue.

Well we'd better give ourselves up             then.We can't, Boss.Why not?We haven't done anything illegal.No I think being illegal makes it more exciting.Yes, I agree. I mean, if you're going to go straight             you might as well be a vicar or something.What?I agree. If there were fewer robbers             there wouldn't be so many of them, numerically speaking.I think sexual ecstasy is over rated.Well, how very interesting, because I'm now made             entirely of tin.After a few more of these remarks, I shall be             appearing in a sketch, so stay tuned.It's the uniform that puts them off, that and             my bad breath.matter of factly We like dressing up, yesHello again. I am at present still on film, but             in a few seconds I shall be appearing in the studio. Thank you.I am.Superintendent Parrot and I are from the hygiene             squad. We want to have a word with you about your box of chocolates             certified The Whizzo Quality Assortment.Ah, yes.Agreed.Next we have number four, 'crunchy frog'.Ah, yes.Am I right in thinking there's a real frog in             here?Yes. A little one.What sort of frog?A dead frog.Is it cooked?No.What, a raw frog?We use only the finest baby frogs, dew picked and             flown from Iraq, cleansed in finest quality spring water, lightly             killed, and then sealed in a succulent Swiss quintuple smooth treble             cream milk chocolate envelope and lovingly frosted with glucose.That's as maybe, it's still a frog.What else?Well don't you even take the bones out?If we took the bones out it wouldn't be crunchy             would it?Superintendent Parrot ate one of those.It says 'crunchy frog' quite clearly.Well, the superintendent thought it was an almond             whirl. People won't expect there to be a frog in there. They're             bound to think it's some form of mock frog.Nevertheless, I must warn you that in future you             should delete the words 'crunchy frog', and replace them with the             legend 'crunchy raw unboned real dead frog', if you want to avoid             prosecution.What about our sales?We use choicest juicy chunks of fresh Cornish             ram's bladder, emptied, steamed, flavored with sesame seeds whipped             into a fondue and garnished with lark's vomit.Lark's vomit?Correct.Well it don't say nothing about that here.Oh yes it does, on the bottom of the box, after             monosodium glutamate.Our sales would plummet.Ah   now, that's our specialty   covered with             darkest creamy chocolate. When you pop it in your mouth steel bolts             spring out and plunge straight through both cheeks.Well where's the pleasure in that?If people place a nice chocky in their mouth, they don't want             their cheeks pierced. In any case this is an inadequate description             of the sweetmeat. I shall have to ask you to accompany me to the             station.Stop talking to the camera.I'm sorry.If only the general public would take more care             when buying its sweeties, it would reduce the number of man hours             lost to the nation and they would spend less time having their             stomachs pumped and sitting around in public lavatories.The BBC would like to apologize for the             extremely poor quality of the next announcement, only he's not at             all well.We present The Dull Life of a City Stockbroker.We present 'The Dull Life of a City Stockbroker'.the stockbroker is at the head of it; there are four             people behind him. As they wait, the Frankenstein monster comes up             behind them and works his way along the queue, killing each member             as he goes.The monster has just reached the stockbroker   who has not seen             him   when the bus arrives and the stockbroker gets on, just in             time.all the other passengers are uniformed soldiers. The             bus drives along a road past explosions and gunfire.A hand grenade comes through the window and lands on the seat             next to the stockbroker. The soldiers leave the bus rapidly; the             stockbroker calmly leaves the bus and walks down the street, in             which the soldiers are engaging in a pitched battle. The stockbroker             hails a taxi; it stops but no driver is visible!a secretary is dead across her typewriter with             a knife in her back; at the back of the office a pair of legs swing             gently from the ceiling; a couple are snogging at his desk.Unconcerned, the stockbroker sits down.Furtively he looks round, then takes from the desk drawer a             comic book entitled 'Thrills and Adventure'.We see the frames of the comic strip. A Superman type character             and a girl are shrinking from an explosion. She is saying 'My God,             he's just exploded with enough force to destroy his Kleenex. In the             next frame, the Superman character is saying 'If only I had a             Kleenex to lend him   or even a linen handkerchief  but these             trousers!! No back pocket!'In the frame beneath, Superman flies from side to side             attempting to escape; finally he breaks through, bringing the two             frames above down on himself.

Tonight we're going to take a             hard tough abrasive look at camel spotting. Hello.Hello Peter.Now tell me, what exactly are you doing?Er well, I'm camel spotting. I'm spotting to see             if there are any camels that I can spot, and put them down in my             camel spotting book.Good. And how many camels have you spotted so             far?Oh, well so far Peter, up to the present moment,             I've spotted nearly, ooh, nearly one.Nearly one?Er, call it none.Fine. And er how long have you been here?Three years.So, in, er, three years you've spotted no             camels?Yes in only three years. Er, I tell a lie, four,             be fair, five. I've been camel spotting for just the seven years.             Before that of course I was a Yeti Spotter.A Yeti Spotter, that must have been extremely             interesting.Oh, it was extremely interesting, very, very               quite it was dull; dull, dull, dull, oh God it was dull. Sitting             in the Waterloo waiting room. Course once you've seen one Yeti             you've seen them all.And have you seen them all?Well I've seen one. Well a little one a             picture of a I've heard about them.Well, now tell me, what do you do when you             spot a camel?Er, I take its number.Camels don't have numbers.Ah, well you've got to know where to look. Er,             they're on the side of the engine above the piston box.What?Ah   of course you've got to make sure it's not a             dromedary. 'Cos if it's a dromedary it goes in the dromedary book.Well how do you tell if it's a dromedary?Ah well, a dromedary has one hump and a camel has             a refreshment car, buffet, and ticket collector.Mr. Sopwith, aren't you in fact a train             Spotter?What?Don't you in fact spot trains?Oh, you're no fun anymore.Oh, you're no fun anymore. thirty nine forty.

I have great pleasure in announcing that owing to a             cutback on surplus expenditure of twelve million Canadian dollars,             plus a refund of seven and a half million Deutschmarks from the             Swiss branch, and in addition adding the debenture preference stock             of the three and three quarter million to the directors' reserve             currency account of seven and a half million, plus an upward             expenditure margin of eleven and a half thousand lira, due to a rise             in capital investment of ten million pounds, this firm last year             made a complete profit of a shilling.A shilling Wilkins?Er, roughly, yes sir.Wilkins, I am the Chairman of a multi million             pound corporation and you are a very new chartered Accountant. Isn't             it possible there may have been some mistake?Well that's very kind of you sir, but I don't             think I'm ready to be Chairman yet.Wilkins, Wilkins. This shilling, is it net             or gross?It's British sir.Yes, has tax been paid on it?Yes, this is after tax. Owing to the rigorous             bite of the income tax five pence of a further sixpence was             swallowed up in tax.Five pence of a further sixpence?Five pence of a further sixpence?That's right sir.Then where is the other penny? Er.That makes you a penny short Wilkins. Where             is it? Erm.Wilkins?What all of it?Yes all of it.You naughty person.It's my first. Please be gentle with me.I'm afraid it's my unpleasant duty to inform you             that you're fired.Oh please, please.No, out!Yes, there's no place for sentiment in big             business.I heard that. Who said that?No I didn't.Ooh!Right!Here is the address to complain to The Royal Frog Trampling Institute, 16 Rayners             Lane, London, W.C. Fields. I'll just repeat thatTristram and Isolde Phillips, 7.30 Covent             Garden Saturday near Sunday and afterwards at the lnigo Jones Fish             Emporium.And they want to put the license fee up?And now here is a reminder about leaving your             radio on during the night. Leave your radio on during the night.A little joke, a little jest. Nothing to worry             about ladies and gentlemen. Now we've got some science fiction for             you, some sci fi, something to send the shivers up your spine, send             the creepy crawlies down your lager and limes. All the lads have             contributed to it, it's a little number entitled, Science Fiction             SketchRead all about it! Read all about it!             Man turns into Scotsman!Mrs. Potter   you knew Harold Potter quite well             I believe?Oh yes quite well.Yes.He was my husband.Yes. And, er, he never showed any inclination             towards being a Scotsman before this happened?He didn't wear a kilt or play the bagpipes?No, no.He never got drunk at night or bought home             black puddings?No, no. Not at all.He didn't have an inadequate brain capacity?No, no, not at all.I see. So by your account Harold Potter was a             perfectly ordinary Englishman without any tendency towards being a             Scotsman whatsoever?Ah hah!  Well that's it, you see. That's how             it starts.I beg your pardon?CharlesDarlingCharlesDarling, darlingCharles there's something I've got to tell youWhat is it darling?It's daddy  he's turned into a ScotsmanWhat! Mr. Llewellyn?Yes, Charles. Help me, please help me.But what can I do?Surely, Charles, you're the Chief Scientist at the             Anthropological Research Institute, at Butley Down   an expert in             what makes people change from one nationality to another.Oh good.Now first of all, why would anyone turn into a             Scotsman?No, no! Only because he has no control over his             own destiny! Look I'll show youI see.Yes! So this means that some person or persons             unknown is turning all these people into ScotsmenOh, what kind of heartless fiend could do that to a             man?I don't know  I don't know  all I know is             that these people are streaming north of the border at the rate of             thousands every hour. If we don't act fast, Scotland will be choked             with ScotsmenOoh!Soon Scotland was full of Scotsmen. The             over crowding was pitiful.Three men to a caber.For the few who remained, life was             increasingly difficult.Charles! Thank goodness I've found you! It's mummy!Hello mummy.No, no, mummy's turned into a ScotsmanOh how horrible Will they stop at nothing?I don't know   do you think they will?I meant that rhetorically.What does rhetorically mean?It means, I didn't expect an answer.Oh I see. Oh, you're so clever, Charles.Did mummy say anything as she changed?Well, what was it?No  It's just the incidental music for this             scene.Oh I see'Them'  Wait a minute!A whole minute?No, I meant that metaphorically  'Them'              'Them'  She was obviously referring to the people who turned her             into a Scotsman. If only we knew who 'They' were  And why 'They'             were doing it Who are 'Them'?Then suddenly a clue turned up in             Scotland. Mr. Angus Podgorny, owner of a Dunbar menswear shop,             received an order for 48,000,000 'kilts from the planet Skyron in             the Galaxy of Andromeda.Angus how are y'going to get 48,000,000             kilts into the van?I'll have t'do it in two goes.D'you not ken that the Galaxy of Andromeda             is two million, two hundred thousand light years away?Is that so?Aye  and you've never been further than             Berwick on TweedAye  I think you ought not to go, Angus.Aye . . but he hasn't signed the order yet,             has he?Who?Ach  the man from Andromeda.Och  well  he wasna really a man, d'you ken             Angus Podgorny, what do y'mean?He wasna so much a man as a blancmange!A blancmange, eh?Yes, that's fight. I was just having a game of             doubles with Sandra and Jocasta, Alec and DavidHang on!What?There's five.What?Five people . . . how do you play doubles with             five people?Ah, well  we wereSounds a bit funny if you ask me  playing             doubles with five peopleWell we often play like that Jocasta plays on the             side receiving serviceOh yes?Yes. It helps to speed the game up and make it a lot             faster, and it means Jocasta isn't left out.Look, are you asking me to believe that the five             of you was playing doubles, when on the very next court there was a             blancmange playing by itself?.That's right, yes.Well answer me this then   why didn't Jocasta             play the blancmange at singles, while you and Sandra and Alec and             David had a proper game of doubles with four people?Because Jocasta always plays with us. She's a friend             of ours.Call that friendship? Messing up a perfectly             good game of doubles?It's not messing it up, officer, we like to play             with five.Look it's your affair if you want to play with             five people  but don't go calling it doubles. Look at Wimbledon,             fight? If Fred Stolle and Tony Roche played Charlie Pasarell and             Cliff Drysdale and Peaches Bartcowitz they wouldn't go calling it             doubles.But what about the blancmange?That could play Ann Haydon Jones and her husband             Pip.Oh, a blancmange gave you an order for             48,000,000 kilts?Aye!And you believed it?Aye, I did.Och, you're a stupid man, Angus Podgorny.Even if it's from a blancmange?Och, woman, if a blancmange is prepared to come             2,200,000 light years to purchase a kilt, they must be fairly keen             on kilts. So cease yer prattling woman and get sewing. This could be             the biggest breakthrough in kilts since the Provost of Edinburgh sat             on a spike. Mary, we'll be rich! We'll be rich!Oh, but Angus he hasna given you an             earnest of his good faith!What is it now?An entry form for the British Open Tennis             Championships at Wimbledon Toon  signed and seconded.Och, but Angus, ye ken full well             that Scots folk dinna know how to play the tennis to save their             lives.Aye, but I must go though dear, I dinna want to             seem ungrateful.Ach! Angus, I wilna let you make a fool             o'yoursel'.But I must.Och, no you'll not Oh, now this is where Mr. Podgorny could have             saved his wife's life. If he'd gone to the police and told them that             he'd been approached by unearthly beings from the Galaxy of             Andromeda, we'd have sent a man round to investigate. As it was he             did a deal with a blancmange, and the blancmange ate his wife. So if             you're going out, or going on holiday, or anything strange happens             involving other galaxies, just nip round to your local police             station, and tell the sergeant on duty   or his wife   of your             suspicions. And the same goes for dogs. So I'm sorry to have             interrupted your exciting science fiction story  but, then,             crime's our business you know. So carry on viewing, and my thanks to             the BBC for allowing me to have this little chat with you.             Goodnight. God bless, look after yourselves.Aye  I'll  do  my best, sergeant.Er, detective inspector.Yes, sir.Are you mad?No, sir.Good. His name's Riley Jack Riley He's             that most rare of criminals  a blancmange impersonator and             cannibal.But what about the 48,000,000 kilts and the Galaxy             of Andromeda?I'm afraid that's just one of his stories. You             must understand that a blancmange impersonator and cannibal has to             use some pretty clever stories to allay suspicion.Then you meanYes.ButHow?Yes.WellNot?I'm afraid so.Why?Who knows?Do you think?Could be.ButI know.She wasYes.It's an extra terrestrial being! Agggh!So, everyone in England is being turned into             Scotsmen, right?Yes.Now, which is the wont tennis playing nation in             the world?Er  Australia.No. Try again.Australia?Oh, I thought you meant I'd said it badly.No, course you didn't say it badly. Now hurry.Er, Czechoslovakia.No! Scotland!Of course.Now  now these blancmanges, apart from the one             that killedhave all appeared in which London suburb?Finchley?No. Wimbledon  Now do you begin to see the             pattern? With what sport is Wimbledon commonly associated?With what sport is Wimbledon commonly associated?Cricket.No.No. Wimbledon is most commonly associated with             tennis.Of course! Now I see!Yes, it all falls into place!'The blancmanges are really Australians trying to get             the rights of the pelote rules from the Czech publishers!Yes. So these blancmanges, blancmange shaped             creatures come from the planet Skyron in the Galaxy of Andromeda.             They order 48,000,000 kilts from a Scottish menswear shop  turn             the population of England into Scotsmen well known as the worst             tennis playing nation on Earth thus leaving England empty during             Wimbledon fortnight! Empty during Wimbledon fortnight  what's             more the papers are full of reports of blancmanges appearing on             tennis courts up and down the country   practicing. This can only             mean one thing!and caption on screen  'THEY MEAN TO WIN             WIMBLEDON'They mean to win Wimbledon. Jarring chord.And it's blancmange to serve and it's             a good one.Blurb blurble blurb.Fifteen love.OAnd Podgorny fails to even hit                 the ball  but this is no surprise as he hasn't hit the ball                 once throughout this match. So it's 72 match points to the                 blancmange now Podgorny prepares to serve again.This is indeed a grim day for                     the human race, Dan.But what's this? Two                     spectators have rushed onto the pitch with spoons and                     forks what are they going to do?They mean to eat the blancmange.And they're eating the                     blancmange  Yes! The blancmange is leaving the court                     it's abandoning the game! This is fantastic!Yes it was Mr. and Mrs. Samuel                     Brainsample, who, after only a brief and misleading                     appearance in the early part of the film, returned to save                     the Earth  but why?Oh, well you see we love                     blancmanges. My wife makes them.She makes blancmanges that size?Oh, yes. You see we're from the                     planet Skyron in the Galaxy of Andromeda, and they're all                     that size there. We tried to tell you at the beginning of                     the film but you just panned off us.So the world was saved! And Angus                     Podgomy became the first Scotsman to win Wimbledon                     fifteen years later.In 1943, a group of British Army Officers             working deep behind enemy lines, carried out one of the most             dangerous and heroic raids in the history of warfare. But that's as             maybe. And now . . .Come in, what do you want?I'd like to leave the army please, sir.Good heavens man, why?It's dangerous.What?There are people with guns out there, sir.What?Real guns, sir.

A bloke was telling me, if you're             in the army and there's a war you have to go and fight.That's true.Well I mean, blimey, I mean if it was a big war             somebody could be hurt.Watkins why did you join the army?For the water skiing and for the travel, sir. And             not for the killing, sir. I asked them to put it on my form, sir               no killing.Watkins are you a pacifist?No sir, I'm not a pacifist, sir. I'm a coward.That's a very silly line. Sit down.Awfully bad.Two civilian gentlemen to see you  sir!Show them in please, sergeant.Mr. Dino Vercotti and Mr. Luigi Vercotti.Good morning, Colonel.Good morning gentlemen. Now what can I do for             you.Yes.We wouldn't want anything to happen to it.What?Oh.Oh sorry, Colonel.Well don't worry about that.

I'm the senior officer here and I haven't had a funny             line yet. So I'm stopping it.You can't do that!I've done it. The sketch is over.I want to leave the army please sir, it's             dangerous.Not true, not true. It's time for the cartoon.             Cue telecine, ten, nine, eightWhat a terrible joke!and superimposed caption 'BUT THERE LET US             LEAVE THE ART CRITIC TO STRANGLE HIS WIFE AND MOVE ON TO PASTURES             NEW'Hello, my wife and I would like to buy a bed,             please.Certainly sir, I'll get someone to help you.Thank you.Mr. Verity!Can I help you, sir?Yes, we'd like a bed, a double bed, and I             wondered if you'd got one for about fifty pounds.Oh no, I'm afraid not, sir.

Otherwise he's perfectly all right.I see, I'm sorry.But it does mean that when he says a bed is             two foot long, it is in fact sixty foot long, all right?Yes, I see.That's without the mattress, of course.How much is that?Er, Mr. Lambert will be able to tell you that.

Where's             your cave?Oh, up the goat track, first on the left.Second Hermit Oh they're very nice up there aren't they?Yes they are, I've got a beauty.A bit draughty though, aren't they?No, we've had ours insulated.Oh yes.Yes, I used birds' nests, moss and oak             leaves round the outside.Oh, sounds marvelous.Oh it's a treat, it really is, 'cos             otherwise those stone caves can be so grim.Yes they really can be, can't they?

Well he says that moss             tends to fall off the cave walls during cold weather. You know you             might get a really bad spell and half the moss drops off the cave             wall, leaving you cold.Oh well, Mr. Robinson's cave's never been             exactly nirvana has it?Well, quite, that's what I mean.

Lovely plumage!Look, I took the liberty of examining that             parrot when I got it home, and I discovered the only reason that it             had been sitting on its perch in the first place was that it had             been NAILED there.Well, o'course it was nailed there! If I hadn't             nailed that bird down, it would have nuzzled up to those bars, bent             'em apart with its beak, and VOOM! Feeweeweewee!VOOM?!?

Fear of a new kind of             violence which is terrorizing the city. Yes, gangs of old ladies             attacking defenseless fit young men.Well they come up to you, like, and push             you   shove you off the pavement, like. There's usually four or five             of them.Yeah, this used to be a nice             neighborhood before the old ladies started moving in. Nowadays some             of us daren't even go down to the shops. 'Well Mr. Johnson's son Kevin, he don't go             out any more. He comes back from wrestling and locks himself in his             room.What are they in it for, these old hoodlums,             these layabouts in lace?favorite targets for the old ladies are             telephone kiosks.Yes, well of course they come here for the             two o'clock matinee, all the old bags out in there, especially if             it's something like 'The Sound of Music'. We get seats ripped up,             hearing aids broken, all that sort of thing.Oh well we sometimes feel we're to blame             in some way for what our gran's become. I mean she used to be happy             here until she, she started on the crochet.Yeah. Now she can't do without it.             Twenty balls of wool a day, sometimes. If she can't get the wool she             gets violent. What can we do about it?But this is not just an old ladies' town.

And this week, Dan falls into a vat of human dung with hilarious             consequences. Ha, ha, ha. But now, it's the glittering world of show             business with Arthur Tree.Hello. Hello people, and welcome to 'It's a             Tree'. We have some really exciting guests for you this evening a             fabulous spruce, back from a tour of Holland; three gum trees making             their first appearance in this country; Scots pine and the conifers,             and Elm Tree Bole there you go; can't be bad an exciting new             American plank, a rainforest and a bucket of sawdust giving their             views on teenage violence, and an unusual guest for this program, a             piece of laminated plastic.Hi there!But first, will you please, please welcome             a block of wood!applauseWell, Block, nice to have you on the show             again.Well, er, thanks, Tree. I've got to pay the             rent.laughinglaughingHa, ha, ha, ha. Super. Well, what have you             been doing, Block?Well, I've just been starring in several             major multi million dollar international films, and, during breaks             on the set, I've been designing a cathedral, doing unpublicized work             for charity, er, finishing my history of the world, of course,             pulling the birds, er, photographing royalty on the loo, averting             World War Three can't be bad and, er, learning to read.The full Renaissance bit, really. Super.             Super. Well, I've got to stop you there, Block, I'm afraid, because             we've got someone who's been doing cabaret in the New Forest. From             America, will you please welcome a Chippendale writing desk!Thank you, Mr. Tree. And I'd             like to do a few impersonations of some of my favorite Englishmen.             First off, Long John Sliver.Augh, Jim boy. Augh. And now, Edward Heath. Hello sailor. Now, a             short scene from a play by Harold Splinter.Wasn't that just great, ladies and gentlemen?             Wait a minute. We've got something else I just know you're going to             love.Yes, sir. Coming right up the Vocational Guidance Counselor             sketch.Ah Mr. Anchovy. Do sit down.Thank you. Take the weight off the feet, eh?Yes, yes.Lovely weather for the time of year, I must say.Enough of this gay banter. And now Mr. Anchovy,             you asked us to advise you which job in life you were best suited             for.That is correct, yes.Well I now have the results here of the             interviews and the aptitude tests that you took last week, and from             them we've built up a pretty clear picture of the sort of person             that you are. And 1 think I can say, without fear of contradiction,             that the ideal job for you is chartered accountancy.But I am a chartered accountant.Jolly good. Well back to the office with you             then.No! No! No! You don't understand. I've been a             chartered accountant for the last twenty years. I want a new job.             Something exciting that will let me live.Well chartered accountancy is rather exciting             isn't it?Exciting? No it's not. It's dull. Dull. Dull. My             God it's dull, it's so desperately dull and tedious and stuffy and             boring and des per ate ly DULL.Well, er, yes Mr. Anchovy, but you see your             report here says that you are an extremely dull person. You see, our             experts describe you as an appallingly dull fellow, unimaginative,             timid, lacking in initiative, spineless, easily dominated, no sense             of humor, tedious company and irrepressibly drab and awful. And             whereas in most professions these would be considerable drawbacks,             in chartered accountancy they are a positive boon.But don't you see, I came here to find a new job,             a new life, a new meaning to my existence. Can't you help me?Well, do you have any idea of what you want to             do?Yes, yes I have.What?boldly Lion taming.Well yes. Yes. Of course, it's a bit of a jump             isn't it? I mean, er, chartered accountancy to lion taming in one             go. You don't think it might be better if you worked your way             towards lion taming, say, via banking'No, no, no, no. No. I don't want to wait. At nine             o'clock tomorrow I want to be in there, taming.Fine, fine. But do you, do you have any             qualifications?Yes, I've got a hat.A hat?'Yes, a hat. A lion taming hat. A hat with 'lion             tamer' on it. I got it at Harrods. And it lights up saying 'lion             tamer' in great big neon letters, so that you can tame them after             dark when they're less stroppy.I see, I see.And you can switch it off during the day time,             and claim reasonable wear and tear as allowable professional             expenses under paragraph 335CYes, yes, yes, I do follow, Mr. Anchovy, but             you see the snag is if I now call Mr. Chipperfield and say to             him, 'look here, I've got a forty five year old chartered accountant             with me who wants to become a lion tamer', his first question is not             going to be 'does he have his own hat?' He's going to ask what sort             of experience you've had with lions.Well I  I've seen them at the zoo.Good, good, good.Lively brown furry things with short stumpy legs             and great long noses. I don't know what all the fuss is about, I             could tame one of those. They look pretty tame to start with.And these, er, these lions  how high are             they?Really. And do these lions eat ants?Yes, that's right.Er, well, Mr. Anchovy  I'm afraid what             you've got hold of there is an anteater.A what?An anteater. Not a lion. You see a lion is a             huge savage beast, about five feet high, ten feet long, weighing             about four hundred pounds, running forty miles per hour, with masses             of sharp pointed teeth and nasty long razor sharp claws that can rip             your belly open before you can say 'Eric Robinson', and they look             like this.Time enough I think for a piece of wood.The larch.Now, shall I call Mr. Chipperfield?Er, no, no, no. I think your idea of making the             transition to lion taming via easy stages, say via insuranceOr banking.Or banking, yes, yes, banking that's a man's             life, isn't it? Banking, travel, excitement, adventure, thrills,             decisions affecting people's lives.Jolly good, well, er, shall I put you in touch             with a bank?Yes.Fine.The League for Fighting Chartered Accountancy,            55 Lincoln House, Basil Street,             London, SW3.Oh, well that was fun wasn't it?No it wasn't, you fairy.sarcastically Oh, hello sailor,Here, you wouldn't have got on one of our voyages               they were all dead butch.There is an epic quality about the sea which             has throughout history stirred the hearts and minds of Englishmen of             all nations. Sir Francis Drake, Captain Webb, Nelson of Trafalgar             and Scott of the Antarctic   all rose to the challenge of the mighty             ocean. And today another Englishman may add his name to the golden             roll of history Mr. Ron Obvious of Neaps End. For today, Ron             Obvious hopes to be the first man to jump the Channel·Ron, now let's just get this quite clear               you're intending to jump across the English Channel?Oh yes, that is correct, yes.And, er, just how far is that?Oh, well it's twenty six miles from here to Calais.Er, that's to the beach at Calais?Well, no, no, provided I get a good lift off and             maybe a gust of breeze over the French coast, I shall be jumping             into the centre of Calais itself.Ron are you using any special techniques to             jump this great distance?Oh no, no. I shall be using an ordinary two footed             jump, er, straight up in the air and across the Channel.I see. Er, Ron, what is the furthest distance             that you've jumped, er, so far?Er, oh, eleven foot six inches at Motspur Park on             July 22nd. Er, but I have done nearly twelve feet unofficially.I see. Er, Ron, Ron, Ron, aren't you worried             Ron, aren't you worried jumping twenty six miles across the sea?Oh, well no, no, no, no. It is in fact easier to jump             over sea than over dry land.Well how is that?Er, well my manager explained it to me. You see if             you're five miles out over the English Channel, with nothing but sea             underneath you, er, there is a very great impetus to say in the air.I see. Well, er, thank you very much Ron and             the very best of luck.Thank you. Thank you.Er, no, we're from the BBC, Mr. Vercotti.Who?The BBC.Oh, oh. I see. I thought, I thought you were             the er . .. I like the police a lot, I've got a lot of time for             them.Mr. er, Mr. Vercotti, what is your chief task             as Ron's manager?Well my main task is, er, to fix a sponsor             for the big jump.And who is the sponsor?The Chippenham Brick Company. Ah, they, er,             pay all the bills, er, in return for which Ron will be carrying half             a hundredweight of their bricks.No. No. I'm taking him off the jumps, Er,             because I've got something lined up for Ron next week that I think             is very much more up his street.Er, what's that?Er, Ron is going to eat Chichester             Cathedral.Well, there he goes, Ron Obvious of Neaps             End, in an attempt which could make him the first man ever to eat an             entire Anglican Cathedral.Java.Yeah, er, I, I personally think this is             going to make Ron a household name overnight.And how far has he got?Er, well, he's quite far now, Dave, well on             the way. Well on the way, yeah.Well where is he exactly?Yeah.Where?Oh, er, well, er, you know, it's difficult             to say exactly. He's er, you know, in the area of er, Ron, how far             have you got?Yeah well keep digging lad, keep digging.Mr. Vercotti are you sure there isn't a spade?Er, Mr. Vercotti, what do you say to people             who accuse you of exploiting Ron for your own purposes?Well, it's totally untrue, David. Ever since             I left Sicily I've been trying to do the best for Ron. I know what             Ron wants to do, I believe in him and I'm just trying to create the             opportunities for Ron to do the kind of things he wants to do.And what's he going to do today?The only difficult bit for Ron is getting             out of the Earth's atmosphere. Er, once he's in orbit he'll be able             to run straight to Mercury.I am now extremely hopeful that Ron will             break the world record for remaining underground. He's a wonderful             boy this, he's got this really enormous talent, this really huge             talent.Good morning, I'd like to buy a cat.no, I want a cat really.Well, it's as near as dammit.Well what do you mean? I want a cat.Listen, tell you what. I'll file its legs down             a bit, take its snout out, stick a few wires through its cheeks.             There you are, a lovely pussy cat.Its not a proper cat.What do you mean?Well it wouldn't meow.Well it would howl a bit.No, no, no, no. Er, have you got a parrot?how long would that take?No, I'm still putting a tuck in the             Airedale, and then I got the frogs to let out.Friday?No I need it for tomorrow. It's a present.Oh dear, it's a long job. You see parrot             conversion  Tell you what though, for free, terriers make lovely             fish. I mean I could do that for you straight away. Legs off, fins             on, stick a little pipe through the back of its neck so it can             breathe, bit of gold paint, make good You'd need a very big tank.It's a great conversation piece.Yes, all right, all right  but, er, only if I can             watch.Here what was that picture?Eric That's right, yes.Er, do take a seat.Now could you tell us roughly why you want to             become a librarian?Er, well, I've had a certain amount of experience             running a library at school.Yes, yes. What sort of experience?Er, well for a time I ran the Upper Science             Library.Yes, yes. Now Mr. Phipps, you do realize that             the post of librarian carries with it certain very important             responsibilities. I mean, there's the selection of books, the record             library, and the art gallery. Now it seems to me that your greatest             disadvantage is your lack of professional experience  coupled             with the fact that, urn, being a gorilla, you would tend to frighten             people.Yes he is.Well why didn't it say on his form that he's a             gorilla?Well, you see applicants are not required to             fill in their species.What was that picture?Sh!  Mr. Phipps, what is your attitude toward             censorship in a public library?How do you mean, sir?Well I mean for instance, would you for instance             stock 'Last Exit to Brooklyn' or  'Groupie'?Yes, I think so.Good.Yes, well, that seems to me to be very sensible             Mr. Phipps. I can't pretend that this library hasn't had its             difficulties  Mr. Robertson, your predecessor, an excellent             librarian, savaged three people last week and had to be destroyed.I'm sorry sir.Oh, no, don't be sorry. You see, I don't believe             that libraries should be drab places where people sit in silence,             and that's been the main reason for our policy of employing wild             animals as librarians.And also, they're much more permissive. Pumas keep             Hank Janson on open shelvesI  don't think I can sir.Why not?I.. I'm not really a gorillaEh?I'm a librarian in a skin Why this deception?Well, they said it was the best way to get the             job.Dear David Jacobs, East Grinstead,             Friday.

Yours etc., Ken Voyeur.Dear Sir, I object strongly to the             obvious athletic turn this show has now taken. Why can't we hear             more about the human body? There is nothing embarrassing or nasty             about the human body except for the intestines and bits of the             bottom.Dear Sir, I object strongly to the             letters on your program.

Since the body was found in             this room, and no one has left it.

Meanwhile here are some friends of mine.From the plastic arts we turn to football.             Last night in the Stadium of Light, Jarrow, we witnessed the             resuscitation of a great footballing tradition, when Jarrow United             came of age, in a European sense, with an almost Proustian display             of modern existentialist football. Vimally annihilating by midfield             moral argument the now surely obsolescent catennachio defensive             philosophy of Signor Alberto Fanffino. Bologna indeed were a side             intellectually out argued by a Jarrow team thrusting and bursting             with aggressive Kantian positivism and outstanding in this fine             Jarrow team was my man of the match, the arch thinker, free             scheming, scarcely ever to be curbed, midfield coguoscento, Jimmy             Buzzard.Good evening Brian.Jimmy, at least one ageing football             commentator was gladdened last night by the sight of an English             footballer breaking free of the limpid tentacles of packed             Mediterranean defense.Good evening Brian.Were you surprised at the way the Italian             ceded midfield dominance so early on in the game?Well Brian I'm opening a boutique.This is of course symptomatic of a new breed             of footballer as it is indeed symptomatic of your whole genre of             player, is it not?Good evening Brian.What I'm getting at, Jimmy, is you seem to             have discovered a new concept with a mode in which you dissected the             Italian defense, last night.Do you think Jarrow will adopt a more             defensive posture for the first leg of the next tie in Turkey?Yes, yes   but have you any plans for dealing             with the free scoring Turkish forwards?Well Brian I'm opening a boutique.And now let's take a look at the state             of play in the detective sketch.Alself me to introlow mybodyHello, good evening, and welcome to yet another             edition of 'Interesting People'. And my first interesting person             tonight is the highly interesting Mr. Howard Stools from Kendal in             Westmorland.Good evening Mr. Stools.Mr. Stools, what makes you particularly             interesting?Well, I'm only half an inch long.Well that's extremely interesting, thank you for             coming along on the show tonight Mr. Stools.I thought you'd think that was interesting             David, in factCompère turns to find a boringly dressed man sitting by him.Mr. Walters, are you sure you're invisible?Oh yes, most certainly.Well, Mr. Walters, what's it like being             invisible?Well, whilst we've got interesting people, we met             Mr. Oliver Cavendish whoMr. Oliver Cavendish of Leicester, who claims to             be able to recite the entire Bible in one second, whilst being             struck on the head with a large axe. Ha, ha, wow. We've since             discovered that he was a fraud, yes a fraud, he did not in fact             recite the entire Bible he merely recited the first two words, 'In             the' before his death.voice over Now it's time for 'Interesting             Sport', and this week it's all in cricket, live from the Municipal             Baths, Croydon.With me now is Mr. Ken Dove, twice voted the most             interesting man in Dotking. Ken, I believe you're interested in             shouting.What does your wife think of this?Shut up! At parties for instance people never come up             to me, I just sit there and everybody totallyThat is Tiddles, I believe?Yes, this is, this is Tiddles.Yes, and what does she do?She flies across the studio and lands in a bucket of             water.By herself?No, I fling her,Well that's extremely interesting, Ladies and             gentlemen   Mr. Don Savage and Tiddles.Yes, great, well now for the first lime on             television 'Interesting People' brings you a man who claims he can             send bricks to sleep by hypnosis. Mr. Keith Maniac from Guatemala.Good evening.Keith, you claim you can send bricks to sleep.Yes, that is correct, I canEntirely by hypnosis.You've injured Mr. Stools!Oh  Ah, well, I am afraid that is already             asleep.How do you know?Well, it's not moving .Oh, I see   have we got a moving brick? Yes,             we've got a moving brick, Keith, it's coming over now.There we are, fast asleep.Very good, very good indeed.All done with the eyes.Yes, Mr. Keith Maniac from Guatemala.Mr. Keith Maniac of Guatemala and now four             tired undertakers.We interrupt this very quickly to take you             back to the Jimmy Buzzard interview, where we understand something             exciting's just happened.I've fallen off my chair, Brian.To put England's social legislation in a             European context is Professor Gert Van Der Whoops of the Rijksmuseum             in the Hague.And now Professor R.J. Canning.Because  Drake  was  too  clever             for the German  fleet. Oh I've forgotten what I said now.Well I rink  we  should  reappraise              our concept of the  Battle of Trafalgar.Well well I agree with everything Mr.             Gumby says.Well, I think cement is more interesting             than people think.The stuff of history is indeed woven in the woof.             Pearl Harbor. There are pages in history's book which are written on             the grand scale. Events so momentous that they dwarf man and time             alike. And such is the Battle of Pearl Harbor, re enacted for us now             by the women of Barley Townswomen's Guild.Well we've always been extremely interested in             modern drama  we were of course the first Townswomen's Guild to             perform 'Camp On Blood Island', and last year we did our extremely             popular re enactment of 'Nazi War Atrocities'. So this year we             thought we would like to do something in a lighter veinSo you chose the Battle of Pearl Harbor?Yes, that's right, we did.Well I can see you're all ready to go. So I'll             just wish you good luck in your latest venture.Thank you very much, young man.The Battle of Pearl Harbor. Incidentally, I'm             sorry if I got a little bit shitty earlier on in the program, when I             kept getting interrupted by all these films and things that kept             coming in, but I.,.So I said if it happened again I'd get very angry             and talk to Lord Hill andHey, did you see that?Uhm?Did you see somebody go past the window?What?Another one.Huh?Another one just went past downwards.What?Two people have just fallen out of that window             to their almost certain death.Fine, fine. Fine.Must be a board meeting.Oh, no, that was Robertson.Wilkins.Robertson.Wilkins.Robertson.That was Wilkins.That was Wilkins. He was a good, good, er,             golfer, Wilkins.Very good golfer. Very good golfer. Rotten at             finance. It'll be Parkinson next.Bet you it won't.How much.What?How much do you bet it won't? Fiver?All right.Done.You're on.Don't do it Parky.Come on Parky. Jump Parky. Jump.Come on now be sensible Parky.Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about that             sketch about people failing out of a high building. I have worked             all my life in such a building and have never once.Parkinson!Johnson!Good evening. Tonight 'Spectrum'             looks at one of the major problems in the world today   that old             vexed question of what is going on. Is there still time to confront             it, let alone solve it, or is it too late? What are the figures,             what are the facts, what do people mean when they talk about things?             Alexander Hardacre of the Economic Affairs Bureau.In this graph, this column represents             23% of the population. This column represents 28% of the population,             and this column represents 43% of the population.Telling figures indeed, but what do             they mean to you, what do they mean to me, what do they mean to the             average man in the street? With me now is Professor Tiddles of Leeds             University Professor, you've spent many             years researching into things, what do you think?I think it's too early to tell.ERIC I can say nothing at this             point.Well, you were wrong Professor?Hello.Hello. So where do we stand? Where             do we stand? Where do we sit? Where do we come? Where do we go? What             do we do? What do we say? What do we eat? What do we drink? What do             we think? What do we do?Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Johnson?Yes, that's right. Yes.Thank you.Oh, you must be tired. It's a long way from             Coventry, isn't it?Well, we usually reckon on five and a half hours             and it took us six hours and 53 minutes, with the 25 minute stop at             Frampton Cottrell to stretch our legs; and we had to wait half an             hour to get onto the M5 at Droitwich.Really?Then there was a three mile queue just before             Bridgewater on the A38. We usually come round on the B3339, you see,             just before Bridgewater.Yeah. Really?We decided to risk it 'cause they always say             they're going to widen it there. Yes, well just by the intersection             there where the A372 joins up. There's plenty of room to widen it             there, there's only grass verges. They could get another six feet,             knock down that hospital. Then we took the coast road through             Williton   we got all the Taunton traffic on the A358 from Crowcombe             and Stogumber.Well you must be dying for a cup of tea.Well, wouldn't say no, long as it's warm and wet.Well come on in the lounge, I'm just going to             serve afternoon tea.Very nice.Come on in, Mr. and Mrs. Johnson and meet Mr.             and Mrs. Phillips.Good afternoon.Good afternoon.It's their third time here; we can't keep you             away, can we?

No they didn't realize they were supposed to             start. Never mind, we'll soon sort that out, the judge is explaining             it to them now. I think Nigel and Gervaise have got the idea. All             set to go.Oh, and they're off and it's a fast start this year. Oliver St             John Mollusc running a bit wide there and now they're coming into             their first test, the straight line.They've got to walk along this straight line without failing over             and Oliver's over at the back there, er, Simon's coming through             quite fast on the outside, I think Simon and Nigel, both of them             coming through very fast. There's Nigel there. No. Three, I'm sorry,             and on the outside there's Gervaise coming through just out of shot             and now, the positionSimon and Vivian at the front coming to the matchbox jump.. three             layers of matchboxes to clear and Simon's over and Vivian's over             beautifully, oh and the jump of a lifetime   if only his father             could understand. Here's Nigel  and now Gervaise is over he's,             er, Nigel is over, and it's Gervaise, Gervaise is going to jump it,             is it, no he's jumped the wrong way, there he goes, Nigel's over,             beautifully. Now it's only Oliver. Oliver  and Gervaise oh bad             luck. And now it's Kicking the Beggar.Simon's there and he's putting the boot in, and not terribly             hard, but he's going down and Simon can move on. Now Vivian's there.             Vivian is there and waiting for a chance. Here he comes, oh a             piledriver, a real piledriver, and now Simon's on No. l, Vivian 2,             Nigel 3, Gervaise on 4 and Oliver bringing up the rear. Ah there's             OliverThere's Oliver now, he's at the back. I think he's having a             little trouble with his old brain injury, he's going to have a go,             no, no, bad luck, he's up, he doesn't know when he's beaten, this             boy, he doesn't know when he's winning either. He doesn't have any             sort of sensory apparatus. Oh there's GervaiseAnd he's putting the boot in there and he's got the beggar down             and the steward's giving him a little bit of advice, yes, he can             move on now, he can move on to the Hunt Photograph. He's off,             Gervaise is there and Oliver's still at the back having trouble with             the matchboxes.Now here's the Hunt Ball Photograph and the first here's Simon,             he's going to enjoy a joke with Lady Arabella Plunkett. She hopes to             go into films, and Vivian's through there and, er, Nigel's there             enjoying a joke with Lady Sarah Pencil Farthing Vivian Streamroller             Adams Pie Biscuit Aftershave Gore Stringbottom Smith.And there's, there's Simon now in the sports car, he's reversed             into the old woman, he's caught her absolutely beautifully. Now he's             going to accelerate forward there to wake up the neighbor. There's             Vivian I think, no Vivian's lost his keys, no there's Vivian, he's             got the old woman, slowly but surely right in the midriff, and here             he is. Here he is to wake up the neighbor now.Simon right in the lead, comfortably in the lead, but he can't             get this neighbor woken up. He's slamming away there as best he can.             He's getting absolutely no reaction at all. There, he's woken him up             and Simon's through. Here comes Vivian, Vivian to slam the door, and             there we are back at the Hunt Ball, I think that's Gervaise there,             that's Gervaise going through there, and here, here comes Oliver,             brave Oliver. Is he going to make it to the table, no I don't think             he is, yes he is,He did it, ohh. And the crowd are rising to him there, and there             I can see, who is that there, yes that's Nigel, Nigel has woken the             neighbor   my God this is exciting. Nigel's got very excited and             he's going through and here comes Gervaise. Gervaise, oh no this is,             er, out in the front there is Simon who is supposed to insult the             waiter and he's forgotten.And Oliver has run himself over,What a great twit! And now here comes Vivian, Vivian to insult             the waiter, and he is heaping abuse on him, and he is humiliating             him, there and he's gone into the lead. Simon's not with him, no             Vivian's in front of him at the bar.Simon's got to get under this bar and this is extremely difficult             as it requires absolutely expert co ordination between mind and             body. No Vivian isn't there. Here we go again and Simon's fallen             backwards. Here's Nigel, he's tripped, Nigel has tripped, and he's             under and Simon fails again, er, here is Gervaise, and Simon is             through by accident. Here's Gervaise to be the last one over, there             we are, here's Nigel right at the head of the field,And now he's going to shoot the rabbit, and these rabbits have             been tied to the ground, and they're going to be a bit frisky, and             this is only a one day event. And they're blazing away there.             They're not getting quite the results that they might, Gervaise is             in there trying to bash it to death with the butt of his rifle, and             I think Nigel's in there with his bare hands, but they're not             getting the results that they might, but it is a little bit misty             today and they must be shooting from a range of at least one foot.             But they've had a couple of hits there I think, yes, they've had a             couple of hits, and the whole field is up again and here they are.They're coming up to the debs, Gervaise first, Vivian second,             Simon third. And now they've got to take the bras off from the             front, this is really difficult, this is really the most, the most             difficult part of the entire competition, and they're having a bit             of trouble in there I think, they're really trying now and the crowd             is getting excited, and I think some of the twits are getting rather             excited too.Vivian is there, Vivian is coming through, Simon's in second             place, and, no there's Oliver, he's not necessarily out of it. There             goes Nigel, no he's lost something, and Gervaise running through to             this final obstacle.Nigel is third in this fine and most exciting Upperclass Twit of the             Year Show I've ever seen. Nigel's clubbed himself into fourth place.Well there'll certainly be some car door slamming in the streets             of Kensington tonight.Now I understand that you want to marry my             daughter?Yes, you realize of course that Rosaround is still             rather young?Well I'm sure you know what I mean, Mr.  er             Mr er .. er?Shabby Ken ShabbyMr. Shabby I just want to make sure that you'll             be able to look after my daughterOh yeah, yeah.

Know what I mean. Oooh!And when do you expect to get married?Oh, fight away sport. Right away you know I             haven't had it for weeksWell look I'll phone the bishop and see if we can             get the AbbeyThe story so far Rosamund's father has become             ensnared by Mr. Shabby's extraordinary personal magnetism. Bob and             Janet have eaten Mr. Farquar's goldfish during an Oxfam lunch, and             Mrs. Elsmore's marriage is threatened by Doug's insistence that he             is on a different level of consciousness. Louise's hernia has been             confirmed, and Jim, Bob's brother, has run over the editor of the             'Lancet' on his way to see Jenny, a freelance Pagoda designer. On             the other side of the continent Napoleon still broods over the             smoldering remains of a city he had crossed half the earth to             conquer whilst Mary, Roger's half sister, settles             down to watch televisionThere now follows a Party Political Broadcast             on behalf of the Wood Party.Good evening. We in the Wood Party feel very             strongly that the present weak drafting of the Local Government Bill             leaves a lot to be desired, and we intend to fight.Are you all fight minister?I appear to have landed on this kind of ledge             thing.Shall we lower down one of the BBC ropes?If you'd be so kind.What length of BBC rope will we be likely to need?I should use the longest BBC rope. That would be             a good idea I would imagine.Okie dokie chief. Er, Tex get the longest BBC rope,             and bring it here pronto.Er, well perhaps when the rope reaches you minister             you could kind of swing over to the ledge and grab it.Good idea.Well I'm going to carry on, if I can read the             script. He swings over to a ledge opposite with a script on it. As             he gets near he peers and starts reading.Look, look, I must look a bit of a chump hanging             upside down like this.Oh good, good. Well  er er um Good             evening. Er  well er how are you? Er Oh yes look, I             don't want you to think of the Wood Party as a load of old men that             like hanging around on ropes only I  er  oh  oh.Is this the furthest distance that a             minister has fallen? Robert.Well surprisingly not. The Canadian             Minister for External Affairs fell nearly seven miles during a             Liberal Conference in Ottawa about six years ago, and then quite             recently the Kenyan Minister for Agric. and Fish fell nearly twelve             miles during a Nairobi debate in Parliament, although this hasn't             been ratified yet.Er, how far did the Filipino cabinet fall             last March?Er, well they fell nearly thirty nine miles             but it's not really so remarkable as that was due to their combined             weight, of course. Robert.Thank you, Robert. Well now what's your             reaction to all this, Robert?Thank you Robert. Well that seems to be             about all we have time for tonight. Unless anyone has anything else             to say. Has anyone anything else to say?What do we mean by no, what do we mean by yes,             what do we mean by no, no, no. Tonight Spectrum looks at the whole             question of what is no.There will now be a short intermission.There will now be a medium sized intermission.             Same music, same speed, slightly longer.Oo I don't like this, Bob I don't like that. Oh I             don't think much to all this. Oh fancy using that wallpaper. Fancy             using mustard. Oo is that a proper one? Oo it's not real. Oh 1 don't             think it's a proper restaurant unless they give you finger bowls. Oo             I don't like him. I'm going to have a baby in a few years.That's all right sir, we get all sorts of lines in             here. The head waiter will be along to abuse you in a few moments,             and now if you'll excuse me I have to go and commit suicide.Oh I'm sorry.It's all right. It's not because of anything             serious.Quite frankly I'm against people who commit suicide,             I don't like that sort of person at all. I'm plain people and I'm             proud of it, my mother's the salt of the earth, and I don't take the             pill 'cos it's nasty.Fine. I'm the head waiter. This is a             vegetarian restaurant only, we serve no animal flesh of any kind.             We're not only proud of that, we're smug about it. So if you were to             come in here asking me to rip open a small defenseless chicken, so             you could chew its skin and eat its intestines, then I'm afraid I'd             have to ask you to leave.No, no, no, no.Sometimes Shirley I think you're almost human.Once I married someone who was beautiful, and young,             and gay, and free. Whatever happened to her?You divorced her and married me.I met my second wife at a             second wife swapping party. Trust me to arrive late.Always were late weren't you Thompson?Hello Headmaster. What are you doing here?Fine, fine, fine, thank you. Fine, thank you.             No more sherry for me don't you know. Warner House beat Badger House             for the Second Cuppa, remarkable. We had to put most of the second             form to sleep. No padre. Bad business.

Oh             what a giveaway.No, we'd like to see the menu please. I don't think             it's a proper restaurant unless you have a proper menu, and anyway I             might be pregnant.Perhaps you'd care for a drink? ,Ever since you've married me, Douglas, you've treated             me like an albatross.Evening.Good evening.I hope you're going to enjoy me this evening.

Janet   to the             kitchen.There's a dead bishop in the lobby, sir.I don't know who keeps bringing them in here.Oh I don't like that. I think it's silly. It's not a             proper sketch without a proper punchline. I mean I don't know much             about anything, I'm stupid. I'm muggins. Nobody cares what I think.             I'm always the one that has to do everything. Nobody cares about me.             Well I'm going to have a lot of bloody babies and they can bloody             well care about me.

Et maintenant avec les pieds à droite, et les pieds au             gauche, et maintenant l'Anglais Française Marche Futile, et voilàAnd now a choice of viewing on BBC Television.             Just started on BBC2, the semi final of Episode 3 of 'Kierkegaard's             Journals', staring Richard Chamberlain, Peggy Mount and Billy             Bremer, and on BBC1, 'Ethel the Frog'Good evening. On 'Ethel the Frog' tonight we             look at violence The violence of British Gangland. Last Tuesday a             reign of terror was ended when the notorious Piranha brothers, Doug             and Dinsdale, after one of the most extraordinary trials in British             legal history, were sentenced to 400 years imprisonment for crimes             of violence. We examined the rise to power of the Piranhas, the             methods they used to subjugate rival gangs and their subsequent             tracking down and capture by the brilliant Superintendent Harry             'Snapper' Organs of Q Division. Doug and Dinsdale Piranha were born,             on probation, in a small house in Kipling Road, Southwark, the             eldest sons in a family of sixteen. Their father Arthur Piranha, a             scrap metal dealer and TV quizmaster, was well known to the police,             and a devout Catholic. In 1928 he had married Kitty Malone, an             up and coming East End boxer. Doug was born in February 1929 and             Dinsdale two weeks later; and again a week after that. Someone who             remembers them well was their next door neighbor, Mrs. April Simmel.Oh yes Kipling Road was a typical East End             Street, people were in and out of each other's houses with each             other's property all day. They were a cheery lot.Was it a terribly violent areaOh noyes. Cheerful and violent. I             remember Doug was keen on boxing, but when he learned to walk he             took up putting the boot in the groin. He was very interested in             that. His mother had a terrible job getting him to come in for tea.             Putting his little boot in he'd be, bless him. All the kids were             like that then, they didn't have their heads stuffed with all this             Cartesian dualism.At the age of fifteen Doug and Dinsdale started             attending the Ernest Pythagoras Primary School in Clerkenwell. When             the Piranhas left school they were called up but were found by an             Army Board to be too unstable even for National Service. Denied the             opportunity to use their talents in the service of their country,             they began to operate what they called 'The Operation' They would             select a victim and then threaten to beat him up if he paid the             so called protection money. Four months later they started another             operation which the called 'The Other Operation'. In this racket             they selected another victim and threatened not to beat him up if he             didn't pay them. One month later they hit upon 'The Other Other             Operation'. In this the victim was threatened that if he didn't pay             them, they would beat him up. This for the Piranha brothers was the             turning point.Doug and Dinsdale Piranha now formed a gang, which             the called 'The Gang' and used terror to take over night clubs,             billiard halls, gaming casinos and race tracks. When they tried to             take over the MCC they were for the only time in their lives, slit             up a treat. As their empire spread however, Q Division were keeping             tabs on their every move by reading the color supplements.One small time operator who fell foul of             Dinsdale Piranha was Vince Snetterton Lewis.Well one day I was at home threatening the kids             when I looks out through the hole in the wall and sees this tank             pull up and out gets one of Dinsdale's boys, so he comes in nice and             friendly and says Dinsdale wants to have a word with me, so he             chains me to the back of the tank and takes me for a scrape round to             Dinsdale's place and Dinsdale's there in the conversation pit with             Doug and Charles Paisley, the baby crusher, and two film producers             and a man they called 'Kierkegaard', who just sat there biting the             heads of whippets and Dinsdale says 'I hear you've been a naughty             boy Clement' and he splits me nostrils open and saws me leg off and             pulls me liver out and I tell him my name's not Clement and then             he loses his temper and nails me head to the floor.He nailed your head to the floor?At first yeahAnother man who had his head nailed to the             floor was Stig O' Tracy.I've been told Dinsdale Piranha nailed your             head to the floor.No. Never. He was a smashing bloke. He used to buy             his mother flowers and that. He was like a brother to me.But the police have film of Dinsdale actually             nailing your head to the floor.Why?Well he had to, didn't he? I mean there was nothing             else he could do, be fair. I had transgressed the unwritten law.What had you done?Er well he didn't tell me that, but he gave me             his word that it was the case, and that's good enough for me with             old Dinsy. I mean, he didn't *want* to nail my head to the floor. I             had to insist. He wanted to let me off. He'd do anything for you,             Dinsdale would.And you don't bear him a grudge?A grudge! Old Dinsy. He was a real darling.I understand he also nailed your wife's head             to a coffee table. Isn't that true Mrs. O' Tracy?No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.Well he did do that, yeah. He was a hard man.             Vicious but fairVince, after he nailed your head to the             floor, did you ever see him againYeah..after that I used to go round his flat             every Sunday lunchtime to apologize and we'd shake hands and then             he'd nail my head to the floorEvery Sunday?Yeah but he was very reasonable. Once, one Sunday I             told him my parents were coming round to tea and would he mind very             much not nailing my head that week and he agreed and just screwed my             pelvis to a cake stand.Clearly Dinsdale inspired tremendous fear among             his business associates. But what was he really like?walked out with Dinsdale on many occasions and             found him a charming and erudite companion. He was wont to introduce             one to eminent celebrities, celebrated American singers, members of             the aristocracy and other gang leaders,How had he met them?Through his work for charities. He took a warm             interest in Boys' Clubs, Sailors' Homes, Choristers' Associations             and the Grenadier Guards.Was there anything unusual about him?Not him. I should say not. Except, that Dinsdale             was convinced that he was being watched by a giant hedgehog whom he             referred to as 'Spiny Norman'.How big was Norman supposed to be?Normally Spiny Norman was wont to be about twelve             feet from snout to tail, but when Dinsdale was depressed Norman             could be anything up to eight hundred yards long. When Norman was             about Dinsdale would go very quiet and start wobbling and his nose             would swell up and his teeth would move about and he'd get very             violent and claim that he'd laid Stanley Baldwin.Did it worry you that he, for example,             stitched people's legs together?Well it's better than bottling it up isn't it. He             was a gentleman, Dinsdale, and what's more he knew how to treat a             female impersonator.But what do the criminologists think? We asked             The Amazing Kargol and JanetIt is easy for us to judge Dinsdale Piranha             too harshly. After all he only did what many of us simply dream of             doing I'm sorry. After all we should remember that a murderer is             only an extroverted suicide. Dinsdale was a looney, but he was a             happy looney. Lucky bugger.Most of the strange tales concern Dinsdale, but             what about Doug? One man who met him was Luigi Vercotti.How much did they want?They wanted three quarters of a million pounds.Why didn't you call the police?Well I had noticed that the lad with the             thermonuclear device was the chief constable for the area. So a week             later they called again and told me the check had bounced and             said I had to see Doug.Doug?What did he do?He used sarcasm. He knew all the tricks,             dramatic irony, metaphor, bathos, puns, parody, litotes and             satire. He was vicious.By a combination of violence and sarcasm, the             Piranha brothers by February 1966 controlled London and the             Southeast of England. It was in February, though, that Dinsdale made             a big mistake.Lately Dinsdale had become increasingly worried             about Spiny Norman. He had come to the conclusion that Norman slept             in an aeroplane hangar at Luton Airport.The Piranhas realized they had gone too far and             that the hunt was on. They went into hiding. I decided on a subtle             approach, viz. some form of disguise, as the old helmet and boots             are a bit of a giveaway. Luckily my years with Bristol Rep. stood me             in good stead, as I assumed a bewildering variety of disguises. I             tracked them to Cardiff, posing as the Reverend Smiler Egret.             Hearing they'd gone back to London, I assumed the identity of a pork             butcher, Brian Stoats. On my arrival in London, I discovered they             had returned to Cardiff, I followed as Gloucester from _King Lear_.             Acting on a hunch I spent several months in Buenos Aires as Blind             Pew, returning through the Panama Canal as Ratty, in _Toad of Toad             Hall_. Back in Cardiff, I relived my triumph as Sancho Panza in _Man             of la Mancha_ which the Bristol Evening Post described as 'a             glittering performance of rare perception', although the Bath             Chronicle was less than enthusiastic. In fact it gave me a right             panning. I quoteAs for the performance of Superintendent Harry             Snapper Organs as Sancho Panza, the audience were bemused by his             high pitched Welsh accent and intimidated by his abusive ad libs.'Sancho Panza Mr. Organs spoilt an otherwise             impeccably choreographed rape scene by his unscheduled appearance             and persistent cries of What's all this then?'***************** TV Series version continues as follows             *******************Never mind Snapper love you can't win 'em allTrue constable.

Heavy Over.Serious?No, not if it keeps at that level, no.Bally piece of luckOh hello. Everything an right at the back?Yes, they're as quiet as dormice.Dormice?All right, don't anybody move  except to             control the aeroplane  you can move a little to do that.Can I move?Yes, yes, yes. You can move a little bit. Yes.             Sorry, I didn't mean to be so dogmatic when I came in. Obviously you             can all move a little within reason. There are certain involuntary             muscular movements which no amount of self control can prevent. And             obviously any assertion of authority on my part, I've got to take             that into account.Right. I mean one couldn't for example, stop             one's insides from moving.No, no. Good point, good point.And the very fact that the plane is             continuously vibrating means that we're all moving to a certain             extent.And we're all moving our lips, aren't we?Yes, yes.Absolutely.No, the gist of my meaning was that sudden             er Hostess Exaggerated movements Exaggerated violent movements are are out.Well, that's the great thing about these             modern airliners. I mean, I can keep this plane flying with only the             smallest movement and Pancho here doesn't have to move at all.Oh, that's marvellous.Well, this is a scheduled flight to Cuba.I know, I know, that's rather why I came in here             with that point about nobody moving.Within reason.Within reason   yes. I er  er you know, I             want you to fly this plane to Luton  please.Right, well I'd better turn the plane round             then. Stand by emergency systems.Look I don't want to cause any trouble.,No, no, we'll manage, we'll manage.I mean, near Luton will do, you know. Harpenden,             do you go near Harpenden?It's on the flight path.Okay, well, drop me off there. I'll get a bus to             Luton. It's only twenty five minutes.You can be in Luton by lunchtime.Oh, well that's smashing.Hang on! There's no airport at Harpenden.Oh well, look, forget it. Forget it. I'll come to             Cuba, and get a flight back to Luton from there.Well, we could lend you a parachute.No, no, no, no, no. I wouldn't dream of it             wouldn't dream of it dirtying a nice, clean parachute.I know   I know. There's a bale of hay             outside Basingstoke. We' could throw you out.Well, if it's all right.Sure, yeah.Not any trouble?None at all.That's marvellous. Thank you very much. Sorry to             come barging in.Bye bye.Thank you. Bye.Bye.Take this bus to Cuba.But it was with more simple, homespun verses             that McTeagle's unique style first flowered.One woman who remembers McTeagle as a young             friend   Lassie O'Shen.Mr. McTeagle wrote me two poems, between the             months of January and April 1969Could you read us one?Och, I dinna like to they were kinda             personal but I will.Can I have Ł50 to mend the shed? I'm fight on my             uppers. I can pay you back When this postal order comes from             Australia. Honestly. Hope the bladder trouble's getting better.             Love, Ewan.As a Highlander I would like to complain about             some inaccuracies in the preceding film about the poet Ewan McTeagle.             Although his name was quite clearly given as McTeagle, he was             throughout wearing the Cameron tartan. Also I would like to point             out that the BALPA spokesman who complained about aeronautical             inaccuracies was himself wearing a captain's hat, whereas he only             had lieutenant's stripes on the sleeves of his jacket. Also, in the             Inverness pantomime last Christmas, the part of Puss in Boots was             played by a native of New Guinea with a plate in her hp, so that             every time Dick Whittington gave her a French kiss, he got the back             of his throat scraped.Pat a cake, pat a cake baker's man. Good morning,             madam, I'm a psychiatrist.You look like a milkman to me.Go away.They're all number three.No. Try again.They're all number three?Yogurt?Er no.Cream?No.Eggs?No.You are a bloody milkman.Don't you shout at me, madam, don't come that             tone. Now then, I must ask you to accompany me down to the dairy and             do some aptitude tests.I've got better things to do than come down to the             dairy!Mrs. Ratbag, if you don't mind me saying so, you             are badly in need of an expensive course of psychiatric treatment.             Now I'm not going to say a trip to our dairy will cure you, but it             will give hundreds of lower paid workers a good high.All right but how am I going to get home?I'll. run you there and back on my psychiatrist's             float.All right.What are those?Ah, good morning. I'm afraid our regular             psychiatrist hasn't come round this morning  and I've got an ego             block which is in turn making my wife ever assertive and getting us             both into a state of depressive neurosis.Oh, I see, sir. Who's your regular, sir?Jersey Cream Psychiatrists.I'm a doctor. Didn't I see you just now under a Scotsman? .Yes, but I am a doctor. Actually, I'm a             gynecologist but that was my lunch hour.Two pints of cream.Right well I should definitely say you're             suffering from a severe personality disorder, sir, sublimating             itself in a lactic obsession which could get worse depending on how             much money you've got.Yes, yes, I see. And a pot of yogurt, please.I would like to take this opportunity of             complaining about the way in which these shows are continually             portraying psychiatrists who make pat diagnoses of patients'             problems without first obtaining their full medical history.I feel the time has come to complain about people who             make rash complaints without first making sure that those complaints             are justified.Are you referring to me?Not necessarily, however, I would like to point out             that the BALPA spokesman was wearing the British Psychiatric             Association Dinner Dance Club cuff links.Oh yes, I noticed that too.These are not British Psychiatric Association             Dinner Dance Club cuff links.Sorry.They are in fact British Sugar Corporation             Gilbert and Sullivan Society cuff links. It is in fact a sort of             in joke with us lads here at BALPA. I think the last speaker should             have checked his facts before making his own rash complaint.Yes, that'll teach him.Nurse! Would you take Mrs. Pim to see Dr Cream,             please.Certainly, doctor. Walk this way, please.Oh, if I could walk that way ISssssh!Mrs. Pim to see you, Dr Cream.Ah yes.

Without more ado, the first item is a sketch about architects called             'The Architects Sketch'. 'The Architects Sketch'. 'The Architects             Sketch'! 'The Architects Sketch'! Up there! Up there! Up there! Up             there! The architects!Gentlemen, we have two basic             suggestions for the design of this  Up there!Gentlemen, we have two basic             suggestions for the design of this  Architects! Up there! Up there  Shut up! Gentlemen, we have two             basic suggestions  Gentlemen, we have two basic             suggestions for the design of this architectural block, the residential             block, and I thought it best that the architects themselves came in to             explain the advantages of both designs.That must be the first architect now. Ah, yes. It's Mr. Wiggin of             Ironside and Malone.Good morning, gentlemen. Uh,             this is a twelve storey block combining classical neo Georgian features             with all the advantages of modern design. Uhh, the tenants arrive in the             entrance hall here, are carried along the corridor on a conveyor belt in             extreme comfort and past murals depicting Mediterranean scenes, towards             the rotating knives. The last twenty feet of the corridor are heavily             soundproofed. The blood pours down these chutes and the mangled flesh             slurps into these large containers  Excuse me.Hmm?Uh, did you say 'knives'?Uh, rotating knives. Yes.Are you, uh, proposing to             slaughter our tenants?Does that not fit in with your             plans?No, it does not. Uh, we   we             wanted a simple block of flats.Ahh, I see. I hadn't, uh,             correctly divined your attitudeUh, huh huh.towards your tenants.Huh huh.You see, I mainly design             slaughter houses.Yes. Pity.Mind you, this is a real beaut.             I mean, none of your blood caked on the walls and flesh flying out of             the windows inconveniencing passers by with this one. I mean, my life             has been building up to this.Yes, and well done, huh, but             we did want a block of flats.Well, may I ask you to             reconsider? I mean, you wouldn't regret it. Think of the tourist trade.No, no, it's   it's just that             we wanted a block of flats and not an abattoir.Yes, well, that's the sort of             blinkered, philistine pig ignorance I've come to expect from you             non creative garbage. You sit there on your loathsome, spotty behinds             squeezing blackheads, not caring a tinker's cuss for the struggling             artist. You excrement! You whining, hypocritical toadies, with your             color TV sets and your Tony Jacklin golf clubs and your bleeding Masonic             secret handshakes! You wouldn't let me join, would you, you blackballing             bastards! Well, I wouldn't become a freemason now if you went down on             your lousy, stinking knees and begged me!Well, we're sorry you feel             like that, but we, um, did want a block of flats. Nice, though,             the abattoir is. Huh huh.Oh, p p p p the abattoir.That's not important, but if one of you could put in a word for me,             I'd love to be a freemason. Freemasonry opens doors. I mean, um, I   I             was a bit on edge just now, but   but if I was a mason, I'd just sit at             the back and not get in anyone's way.Thank you.I've got a second hand apron.Thank you.I nearly got in at Hendon.Thank you.I'm sorry about that, gentlemen.             The second architect is Mr. Leavey of Wymis and Dibble.Oh.Good morning, gentlemen.Morning.Uhh, this is a scale model of             the block. Uh, there are twenty eight stories with two hundred and             eighty modern apartments. There are three main lifts and two service             lifts. Access would be from Dibbingley Road.Uhh, the structure is built on a central pillar system, uh,with cantilevered floors in pre stressed steel and concrete. Uh,             the dividing walls on each floor section are fixed with recessed             magnalium flanged grooves.Quite frankly, I think the central pillar system may need             strengthening a bit.Isn't that going to put the             cost up?Uh, it might.Well, I don't know whether             I'd worry about strengthening that much. After all, they're not meant to             be luxury flats. Huh.No, I quite agree. I mean,             providing the tenants are of light build and relatively sedentary and,             uhh, er instead given a spot of good weather, I think we're on to a             winner here.Yes.Uh, thank you.I quite agree. I quite agree.Thank you very much. Thank you.It opens doors, I'm telling             you.What other ways are there of recognizing             a mason?No.No?! That's wrong! Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!             Wrong! No! No! Bad!Oh! And the next item is a sketch about insurance             called 'Insurance Sketch'. 'Insurance Sketch'. 'Insurance Sketch'What do you want?Well I've come about your special fully comprehensive             motor insurance policy offerWhat was that?Fully comprehensive motor insurance for one and eight             pence.Oh, oh, yes  yeah well, unfortunately, guv,             that offer's no longer valid.

After three fights               and only two convictions   his manager believes that Ken is ready to             face the giant American, Satellite Five.The great thing about Ken is that he's almost             totally stupid.Every morning, he jogs the forty seven miles             from his two bedroomed, eight bathroom, six up two down,             three to go house in Reigate, to the Government's Pesticide Research             Centre at Shoreham. Nobody knows why.Basically Ken is a very gentle,             home loving person. I remember when one of his stick insects had a             knee infection. He stayed up all night rubbing it with germoline and             banging its head on the table.Oh he was such a pretty baby, always so kind and             gentle. He was really considerate to his mother, and not at all the             kind of person you'd expect to pulverize their opponent into a             bloody mass of flesh and raw bone, spitting teeth and fragments of             gum into a ring which had become one man's hell and Ken's glory.I used to wake Ken up with a crowbar on the back             of the head. But I recently found that this was too far from his             brain and I wasn't getting through to him anymore. So I now wake him             up with a steel peg driven into his skull with a mallet.For breakfast every day, Ken places a plate of             liver and bacon under his chair, and locks himself in the cupboard.Well, he's having a lot of mental difficulties             with his breakfasts, but this is temperament, caused by a small             particle of brain in his skull, and once we've removed that he'll be             perfectly all right.Urn, straight down there. Straight down there.Hello. When Ken is in a really deep sleep like             this one, the only way to wake him up is to saw his head off.What is he like in the ring, this human             dynamo, this eighteen stone bantam weight battering ram? We asked             his sparring partner and one time childhood sweetheart, Maureen             Spencer.Well, I think that if Ken keeps his right up,             gets in with the left jab and takes the fight to his man   well, he             should go for a cut eye in the third and put Wilcox on the canvas by             six.Well, I'm a southpaw and I think this will confuse             him, particularly with his brain problem.I think boxin's a splendid sport   teaches             you self defense.Obviously boxing must have its limits, but             providing they're both perfectly fit I can see nothing wrong with             one healthy man heating the bring daylights out of a little             schoolgirl.It's quick and it's fun.Hello, good evening, and welcome to 'It's A             Living'.

It's six and a half minutes to the big green             thing.You're a loony.I get so bored. I get so bloody bored.I'm terribly sorry to interrupt but my tooth's             hurting, just around here.Get off.Oh, sorry.I'm not sorry to interrupt   I'll interrupt             anything if it gets people looking in my direction   like at my old             school where, by a coincidence, the annual prize giving is going on             at this very moment.Velly solly for hold up  no ploblem now              me are Bishop of East Anglia, now piesent plizes  Eyes down for             first plize  The Fyffe Chulmleigh Spoon for Latin Elegaics             'goes to  People's Republic of China! Aaaagh!Good evening, everybody. My name's Bradshaw              Inspector Elizabeth Bradshaw, of the Special Branch Speech Day             Squad, but I'd like you to think of me as the Bishop of East Anglia,             and I'd like to present the first prize, the Grimwade Gynn Trophy             toOh yes, well, I mean, there were some people who             said my film '2001   A Space Odyssey', was similar to Stanley             Kubrick's. I mean, that's the sort of petty critical niggling that's             dogged my career. It makes me sick. I mean, as soon as I'd made             'Midnight Cowboy' with the vicar as Ratso Rizzo, John Schlesinger             rushes out his version, and gets it premiered while mine's still at             the chemist's.Well, we have with us tonight one of your             films, 'Rear Window', which was to become such a success for Alfred             Hitchcock a few weeks later. Now this is a silent film, so perhaps             you could talk us through itYes, well, let's see now  there's the rear             window. There's the man looking out of the window. He sees the             murder. The murderer's come into the room to kill him, but he's             outwitted him and he's all right. The End. I mean, Alfred Hitchcock,             who's supposed to be so bloody wonderful, padded that out to one and             a half hours  lost all the tension  just because he had bloody             Grace Kelly he made Ł3 million more than I did. Mind you, at least             she can act a bit, I could have done with her in 'Finian's Rainbow'              The man from the off license was terrible  a real failure             that was   ten seconds of solid boredom.Bloody terrible.That gives you just some idea of what's going             on out there. Today saw the long awaited publication of the Portman             Committee's Report on Industrial ReorganizationIt's taken five years to prepare and it's             bound to have an enormous impact on the future of industrial             relations in this country. In the studio tonight Lord Porlman,             Chairman of the Committee, Sir Charles Avery, Employers'             Reorganization Council, and Ray Millichope, leader of the Allied             Technicians' Union.

Norman.Well pretty much as I predicted,             except that the Silly party won. Er, I think this is largely due to             the number of votes cast. Gerald.Well there's a big swing here to the             Silly Party, but how big a swing I'm not going to tell you.I think one should point out that in             this constituency since the last election a lot of very silly people             have moved into new housing estates with the result that a lot of             sensible voters have moved further down the road the other side of             number er, 29.Well I can't add anything to that.

Norman.Well this is a very significant             result. Luton, normally a very sensible constituency with a high             proportion of people who aren't a bit silly, has gone completely             ga ga.And we've just heard that James Gilbert             has with him the winning Silly candidate at Luton.Tarquin, are you pleased with this             result?And do we have the swing at Luton?Er no.Can I just say that this is the second             time I've been on television?No, I'm sorry there isn't time, we're             just about to get another result.And this one is from Harpenden             Southeast. A very interesting constituency this in addition to the             official Silly candidate there is an unofficial Very Silly             candidate, in the slab of concrete, and he could well split the             silly vote here at Harpenden Southeast.Mrs. Elsie ZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzSillySensible26,318Very close!Malcolm Peter Brian Telescope Adrian Blackpool Rock             Stoatgobbler John Raw Vegetable Brrroooo Norman Michael rings bell             blows whistle Edward sounds car horn does train impersonation             sounds buzzer Thomas Moo sings We'll keep a welcome in             the fires gun William makes silly noise Raindrops keep             falling on my weird noise Don't sleep in the subway cuckoo             cuckoo Naaoooo Smith.Very Sillytwo.Well there you have it, a Sensible gain             at Harpenden with the Silly vote being split.And we've just heard from Luton that             Tony Stratton Smith has with him there the unsuccessful Slightly             Silly candidate, Kevin Phillips Bong.Kevin Phillips Bong.

Er, Colin?Can I just say that I'll never appear             on television again?No I'm sorry, there isn't time, we have             to pick up a few results you may have missed. A little pink             pussy cat has taken Barrow in Furness    that's a gain from the             Liberals there. Rastus Odinga Odinga has taken Wolverhampton             Southwest, that's Enoch Powell's old constituency    an important             gain there for Darkie Power. Arthur Negus has held Bristols                that's not a result, that's just a piece of gossip. Sir Alec Douglas             Home has taken Oldham for the Stone Dead party. A small piece of             putty about that big, a cheese mechanic from Dunbar and two frogs                one called Kipper the other not    have all gone Ni ni ni ni ni             ni! in Blackpool Central. And so it's beginning to look like a             Silly landslide, and with the prospect of five more years' Silly             government facing us we Oh I don't want to do this any more, I'm             bored!He's right you know, it is a bloody             waste of time.Absolute waste of time.I wanted to be a gynecologistIn the fifth century, as the once mighty             Roman Empire crumbled, the soft underbelly of Western Europe lay             invitingly exposed to the barbarian hordes to the East. Alaric the             Visigoth, Galseric the Vandal and Theodoris the Ostrogoth in turn             swept westward in a reign of terror. But none surpassed in power and             cruelty the mighty Attila the Hun.Ladies and gentlemen, it's the 'The Attila             the Hun Show'.In the second quarter of the fifth             century, the Huns became a byword for merciless savagery. Their Khan             was the mighty warrior Attila. With his devastating armies he swept             across Central Europe.Oh darling, I'm home.Hello darling. Had a busy day at the office?I won't say I'm glad to see you, but boy, am I             glad to see you.Hi, daddy.Hi, daddy.Heah you are, Mr. Hun!Hi, Uncle Tom.There's a whole horde of them marauding             Visigoths to see y'all.It's Yes, it's Attila the Nun.A simple country girl who took a vow of             eternal brutality.Nurse!Hello, Miss Norris. How are you?Not too bad, thank you, doctor.Yes, well I think I'd better examine you.What are they doing here?Thank you, thank you. Charles Crompton, the             Stripping Doctor. And next, gentlemen and ladies, here at the             Peephole Club for the very first time   a very big welcome please             for the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs.Wasn't he marvellous? The Secretary of State for             Commonwealth Affairs! And now gentlemen and ladies, a very big             welcome please for the Minister of Pensions and Social Security!Yes, today in Britain there is a new wave of             interest in politics and politicians.Well, we're just in it for the lobbying, you             know. We just love lobbying.And the debates   you know a good debate              is just fabulous.Well, I've been going with ministers for five             years now and, you know 1 think they're wonderful.Oh yes, I like civil servants.Oh yes, they're nice.I like the Speaker.Oh yes.I like Black Rod.What do their parents think?Well she's broken our hearts, the little             bastard. She's been nothing but trouble and if she comes round here             again I'll kick her teeth in.Have you been talking to television again,             dear?Yes, I bloody told 'em.What about?I dunno.Was it Reginald Bosanquet?No, no, no.Did he have his head all bandaged?No, it wasn't like that. They had lots of             lights and cameras and tape recorders and all that son of thing.Hello   Mr. and Mrs. Concrete?Yes.Well, well, well, well, well, well, well,             well, well, well, well, how very nice. Allow me to introduce myself.             I am Leslie Ames, the Chairman of the Test Selection Committee, and             I'm very pleased to be able to tell you that your flat has been             chosen as the venue for the third test against the West Indies.Really?No, it was just a little joke. Actually, I am             the Council Ratcatcher.Oh yes, we've been expecting you.Oh, I gather you've got a little rodental             problem.Oh, blimey. You'd think he was awake all             the night, scrabbling down by the wainscoting.Um, that's an interesting word, isn't it?What?Wainscoting  Wainscoting  Wainscoting              sounds like a little Dorset village, doesn't it? Wainscoting.We've been mentioned on telly!Now, where is it worst?Well, down here. You can usually hear them.SshhhBaa  baa  baa  baa  baa  baaNo, that's sheep you've got there.Baa  baa.No, that's definitely sheep. A bit of a             puzzle, really.Is it?Yeah, well, I mean it's a not going to             respond to a nice piece of cheese and b it isn't going to fit into             a trap.Oh   what are you going to do?Well, we'll have to look for the hole.Oh yeah. There's one here.No, no, that's mice.Ah, ,this is what we're after.Excuse me, is the third test in here?No   that was a joke   a joke!Right. Well, I'm going in the wainscoting.They said it again.I'm going to lay down some sheep poison.Baa, baa, baa.Aagh. Ooh! It's got a gun!Blimey.Now, normally a sheep is a placid, timid             creature, but you've got a killer.It's an entirely new strain of sheep, a killer             sheep that can not only hold a rifle but is also a first class shot.But where are they coming from, professor? was wearing in yesterday's raid on Selfridges.I'll carry out tests on it straight away,             professor.Hello, is the third test in here, please?Professor, there are some cricketers in the             laboratory.This may be even more serious than even I had             at first been imagining. What a strange strange line. There's no             time to waste. Get me the Chief Commissioner of Police.Yes, sir!No, no, on the phone.Professor! What is it? What have you seen?Look   there, in the doorway.Urghhh! Arthur X! Leader of the Pennine Gang!But soon the killer sheep began to infect other             animals with its startling intelligence. Pussy cats began to arrange             mortgages, cocker spaniels began to design supermarketsAnd parrots started to announce television             programs. It's 8 o'clock and time for the News.Cut back to the same narrator at desk.'Allo, 'allo, 'allo.'Allo, 'allo, 'allo.Who's a pretty boy, then?'Allo, 'allo, 'allo.And while that's going on, here is the news for             gibbons. No gibbons were involved today in an accident on the M 1             In the debate a spokesman accused the Government of             being silly and doing not at all gbod things. The member accepted             this in a spirit of healthy criticism, but denied that he'd ever             been naughty with a choirboy. Angry shouts of 'what about the             watermelon, then?' were ordered by the Speaker to be stricken from             the record and put into a brown paper bag in the lavvy. Any further             interruptions would be cut off and distributed amongst the poor. For             the Government a Front Bench Spokesman said the agricultural tariff             would have to be raised, and he fancied a bit. Furthermore, he             argued, this would give a large boost to farmers, and a lot of fun             to him, his friend and Miss Moist of Knightsbridge. From the back             benches there were opposition shouts of 'postcards for sale' and a             healthy cry of 'who likes a sailor, then?' from the Minister without             Portfolio. Replying, the Shadow Minister said, he could no longer             deny the rumors but he and the dachshund were very happy; and, in             any case, he argued, rhubarb was cheap and what was the harm in a             sauna bath.Well that's all for Attila the Bun, and now               idiots!Arthur Figgis is an idiot. A village             idiot. Tonight we look at the idiot in society.Yes, splendid.That's Mr. Jenkins   he's another idiot. And so             you see the idiot does provide a vital psycho social service for             this community. Oh, excuse me, a coach party has just arrived. I             shall have to fall off the wall, I'm afraid.Arthur takes idiotting seriously. He is up             at six o'clock every morning working on special training equipment             designed to keep him silly. And of course he takes great pride in             his appearance.Like the doctor, the blacksmith, the             carpenter, Mr. Figgis is an important figure in this village and               like them   he uses the local bank.Yes, we have quite a number of idiots             banking here.What kind of money is there in idiotting?Well nowadays a really blithering idiot can make             anything up to ten thousand pounds a year   if he's the head of some             big industrial combine. But of course, the more old fashioned idiot             still refuses to take money.Mr. Brando.Yes?Hollywood on the phone.I'll take it in the office.But Mr. Figgis is no ordinary idiot. He is             a lecturer in idiocy at the University of East Anglia. Here he is             taking a class of third year students.After three years of study these             apprentice idiots receive a diploma of idiocy, a handful of mud and             a kick on the head.But some of the older idiots resent the             graduate idiot.I'm a completely self taught idiot. I mean, ooh             arh, nob arhh, nob arhh . nobody does that anymore. Anybody who             did that round here would be laughed off the street. No, nowadays             people want something wittier.Kevin O'Nassis works largely with walls.But what of the idiot's private life? How             about his relationship with women?Well I may be an idiot but I'm no fool.Eton, Sandhurst and the Guards, ha, ha,             ha, ha.I can't remember but I've got it             written down some where.Daddy's a banker. He needed a wastepaper             basket.Father was Home Secretary and mother             won the Derby.The headquarters of these urban idiots is             here in St John's Wood. Inside they can enjoy the company of other             idiots and watch special performances of ritual idiotting.Well left.Well played.Well well.Well bred.Splendid. Just listen to those thighs. And now it's             the North East's turn with the Samba. Brian.Oh, shut up or we'll close the bar. And now Bo             Wildeburg is running up to bowl to Cowdrey, he runs up, he bowls to             Cowdrey and no shot at all. Extremely well not played             there.Yes, beautifully not done anything about.A superb shot of no kind whatsoever. I well             remember Plum Warner leaving a very similar ball alone in 1732.Gin and tonic please.I well remember a similar divan being brought on at             Headingley in 9 BC against the darkies.Oh, shut up, elephant snout. And now the green             Chesterfield has taken guard and Iceland are putting on their spin             dryer to bowl.The spin dryer moves back to his mark, it runs out to             the wicket, bowls to the table a little bit short but it's coming             in a bit there and it's hit him on the pad and the table is out,             leg before wicket. That is England naught for one.Well here at Epsom we take up the running             with fifty yards of this mile and a half race to go and it's the             wash basin in the lead from WC Pedestal. Tucked in nicely there is             the sofa going very well with Joanna Southcott's box making a good             run from hat stand on the rails, and the standard lamp is failing             fast but it's wash basin definitely taking up the running now being             strongly pressed by  At the post it's the wash basin from WC then             sofa, hat stand, standard lamp and lastly Joanna Southcott's box.Yes, yes;And what's your name?I go to church regularly.Jolly good, I see, and which prize do you             have particular eyes on this evening?I'd like the blow on the head.The blow on the head.Just there.Jolly good. Well your first question for             the blow on the head this evening is what great opponent of             Cartesian dualism resists the reduction of psychological phenomena             to physical states?I don't know that!Well, have a guess.Henri Bergson.Is the correct answer!Ooh, that was lucky. I never even heard of him.Jolly good.I don't like darkies.Ha ha ha. Who does! And now your second             question for the blow on the head is what is the main food that             penguins eat?Pork luncheon meat.No.Spam?No, no, no. What do penguins eat? Penguins.Penguins?Yes.I hate penguins.No, no, no.They eat themselves.No, no, what do penguins eat?Horses!  Armchairs!No, no, no.

Underwater goats with snorkels and flippers.No, no.A buffalo with an aqualung.No, no.Reginald Maudling.Yes, that's near enough. I'll give you             that. Right, now, Mrs. Scum, you have won your prize, do you still             want the blow on the head?Yes, yes.I'll offer you a poke in the eye.No! I want a blow on the head.A punch in the throat.No.All fight then, a kick in the kneecap.No.Mrs. Scum, I'm offering you a boot in the             teeth and a dagger up the strap.ErBlow on the head! Take the blow on the head!No, no. I'll take the blow on the head.Very well then, Mrs. Scum, you have won             tonight's star prize, the blow on the head.Hello. On 'Archaeology Today' tonight I have             with me Professor Lucien Kastner of Oslo University.Good evening.How tall are you, professor? I beg your pardon?How tall are you?I'm about five foot ten.Yes.Funny, you look much shorter than that to me.             Are you slumped forward in your chair at all?No, er IExtraordinary. Sir Robert Eversley, who's             just returned from the excavations in El Ara, and you must be well             over six foot. Isn't that right, Sir Robert?In fact, I think you're six foot five aren't             you?Yes.Oh, that's marvellous. I mean you're a             totally different kind of specimen to Professor Kastner. Straight in             your seat, erect, firm.Yes. I thought we were here to discuss             archaeology.Very good speaking voice. which present dramatic evidence of             Polynesian influence in Egypt in the third dynasty which is quite             remarkable.How tall were the Polynesians?They wereSh!Well, they were rather small, seafaringShort men, were they eh? All squat and             bent up?Well, I really don't know about thatWho were the tall people?I'm afraid I don't know.Who's that very tall tribe in Africa?Well, this is hardly archaeology.The Watutsi! That's it   the Watutsi! Oh,             that's the tribe, some of them were eight foot tall. Can you imagine             that. Eight foot of Watutsi. Not one on another's shoulders, oh no               eight foot of solid Watutsi. That's what I call tall.Yes, but it's nothing to do with archaeology.Bloody fool. Look what you've done to him.Don't bloody fool me.I'll do what I like, because I'm six foot five             and I eat punks like you for breakfast.I'll get you for that, Eversley! I'll get you             if I have to travel to the four corners of the earth!Today I hear the robin sing Today the thrush             is on the wing Today who knows what life will bring TodayYes, it's Sumerian.Oh, how wonderful!

And now an appeal on behalf of the             National Trust.Good morning.Good morning.Are you the registrar?I have that function.I was here on Saturday, getting married to a blond             girl, and I'd like to change please.

That's the trouble of having a surname like Git.Oh  yes, yes.We did think once of having it changed by             deed poll, you know   to Watson or something like that.

Why,             only last week Dirty Lying Little Two Faced came running home from             school, sobbing his eyes out, and our youngest, Ghastly Spotty             Horrible Vicious Little is just at the age when taunts like 'she's a             git' really hun.

I love             animals. That's why I like to kill 'em. I wouldn't kill an animal I             didn't like. Good day Roy.JOHN Hank and Roy Spire are tough, fearless             backwoodsmen who have chosen to live in a violent, unrelenting world             of nature's creatures, where only the fittest survive. Today they             are off to hunt mosquitoes.Suddenly Hank spots the mosquito they're             after.There's nothing more dangerous than a wounded             mosquito.Well, I follow the moth in the helicopter to lure it             away from the flowers, and then Roy comes along in the Lockheed             Starfighter and attacks it with air to air missiles.A lot of people have asked us why we don't use fly             spray. Well, where's the sport in that?Objection here, objection there! And that             nice policeman giving his evidence so well   beautiful speaking             voice  well after a bit all I could do was bang my little gavel.You what, love?I banged me gavel. I did me 'silence in             court' bit. Ooh! If looks could kill that prosecuting counsel would             be in for thirty years. How did your summing up go?Well, I was quite pleased actually. I was             trying to do my butch voice, you know, 'what the jury must             understand', and they loved it, you know. I could see that foreman             eyeing me.Really?Yes, cheeky devil.Was he that tall man with that very big ?No, just a minute   I must finish you know.             Anyway, I finished up with 'the actions of these vicious men is a             violent stain on the community and the full penalty of the law is             scarcely sufficient to deal with their ghastly crimes', and I             waggled my wig! Just ever so slightly, but it was a stunning effect.Oh, I bet it was like that super time I             wore that striped robe in the Magistrates Court.Oh, aye.Hello, Mrs. Thing.Hello, Mrs. Entity.How are you then?Oh, I have had a morning.Busy?Busy   huh! I got up at five o'clock, I             made myself a cup of tea, I looked out of the window. Well, by then             I was so worn out I had to come and have a sit down. I've been here             for seven hours.You must be exhausted.Mm. Oh, have you been shopping?No, I've been shopping.Funny.I'm worn out. I've been shopping for six             hours.What have you bought, then?Nothing. Nothing at all. A complete waste             of time.Wicked, isn't it?Wicked. It'll be worse when we join the             Common Market.That nice Mr. Heath would never allow             that.It's funny he never married.He's a bachelor.Oooh! That would explain it, Oh dear me,             this chatting away wears me out.Yes. I bet Mrs. Reginald Maudling             doesn't have to put up with all this drudgery, getting up at five in             the morning, making a cup of tea, looking out of the window,             chatting away.No! It'd all be done for her.Yes, she'd have the whole day free for             playing snooker.She probably wouldn't go through all the             drudgery of playing snooker, day in, day out.No, it would all be done for her. She             wouldn't even have to lift the cue.She             probably doesn't even know where the billiard room is.No, still, it's not as bad as the old             days. Mrs. Stanley Baldwin used to have to get up at five o'clock in             the morning and go out and catch partridges with her bare hands.Yes and Mrs. William Pitt the EIder             used to have to get up at three o'clock and go burrowing for             truffles with the bridge of her nose.Mrs. Beethoven used to have to get up at             midnight to spur on the mynah bird.Lazy creatures, mynah birds,..Yes.

We had considered a version of Michael             Stewart's speech on Nigeria and there were several votes on the             Committee for a staging of Herr Willi Brandt's visit to East             Germany, but we've settled instead for a dramatization of the first             heart transplant.

Tres interessant.Brian Distel and Brianette Zatapathique there in an             improvised scene from Jean Kenneth Longueur's new movie 'Le Fromage             Grand'. Brian and Brianette symbolize the breakdown in communication             in our modern society in this exciting new film and Longueur is             saying to us, his audience, 'go on, protest, do something about it,             assault the manager, demand your money back'. Later on in the film,             in a brilliantly conceived montage, Longueur mercilessly exposes the             violence underlying our society when Brian and Brianerte again meet             on yet another rubbish dump.Bonjour encore.Bonjour.Je vois que aujourd'jui vous avez une co laitue.Oui.Bon.Il fair beau encore.Oui.Bon.Vous pouvez dire 'a encore.Certainement il fair beau ce matin.Oui.Il fait beau bier.

That was for O. Simon,             K. Simon, P. Simon and R. Sparrow of Leicester. Later on, we're             going to take a look at John Wayne's latest movie, 'Buckets of Blood             Pouring Out of People's Heads' but now we look ahead. On Tuesday             Chris Conger took a BBC film unit to the location where 20th Century             Vole are shooting their latest epic 'Scott of the Antarctic'.Gerry, you chose Paignton as the location for             Scott.Right, right.Isn't it a bit of a drawback that there's no snow             here?Well, we have 28,000 cubic feet of Wintrex, which             is a new white foam rubber which actually on screen looks more like             snow than snow and 1,600 cubic US furlongs of white paint,             with a special snow finish.And I believe Kirk Vilb is playing the tide role.Oh, there you are. Hello. Hello. No problem. Have             a drink. Have a drink. Great. Hello. Marvellous. Marvellous. Hello.             Rewrite. Oh this is really great. I mean, it's really saying             something, don't you think?Have you started shooting yet?Yes, yes. Great. Perfect. No, no, we haven't             started yet. No. But great   great.What is the first scene that you shoot this             morning?Great. Terrific. Oh it's great. No problem. We'll             sort it out on the floor. Sort it out on the floor. No problem. This             film is basically pro humanity and anti bad things and it rips aside             the hypocritical facade of our society's gin and tonic and leaves a             lot of sacred cows rolling around in agony, have a drink, have a             drink.But which scene are we shooting first, Jimmy?No, we didn't.Hi, Lieutenant.Hi, Oatesy. Sure is a beautiful day already.What? What are you saying?I was just saying great, great. Cue Evans.And this is Vanilla Hoare as Miss Evans.Miss Evans?Right.Good morning, Miss Evans.Oh, I've forgotten my line.What's her line? What's her line?It's 'Good morning, Captain Scott'.Oh, yeah. 'Good morning, Captain.' Sc'..; oh, I'm             just not happy with that line. Could I just say Hi Scottie ?Great. Great. Rewrite. Cue.Great! We'll shoot it.Are you sure that's right?Oh, it's great.Jim.Jim! Jim! Oh, me!Jim, I feel we may be running into some problems             here in the area of height.Great! Where are they?Where are who?I don't know. I was getting confused.Jim, I feel here, that Scott may be too tall in             the area of height with reference to Vanilla who is too near the             ground in the area of being too short at this time.Great  Oh, I know. I'm going to dig a pit for             Scott and put a box in Vanilla's trench.Say, why don't I take the boxes off and Vanilla get             up out of the trench.It wouldn't work It's even better! Great.             Rewrite!What was that?Oh, it's easy. I've worked it out. Scott takes             his boxes off and you don't stand in the trench.I say my lines out of the trench?Even better. Great.But I've never acted out of a trench. I might fall             over. It's dangerous.Oh well, could you just try it?Great. Great everyone. Lunch now. Lunch. It's             all in the can. Good morning's work.But you haven't done a shot.Now this afternoon we're going to shoot the scene             where Scott gets off the boat on to the ice floe and he sees the             lion and he fights it and kills it and the blood goes pssssssssshhh             in slow motion.But there aren't any lions in the Antarctic.What?There aren't any lions in the Antarctic.You're right. There are no lions in the             Antarctic. That's ridiculous; whoever heard of a lion in the             Antarctic. Right. Lose the lion.Got to keep the lion. It's great!Lose the lion.Great. We're losing the lion. Rewrite. Lose the             lion everyone. That's fantastic,What's this about our losing the lion?Well, Kirk, we thought perhaps we might lose the             fight with the lion a little bit, Kirk, angel.Well, Kirkie, doll, there are no lions in the             Antarctic, baby.It'd be silly.Listen, I gotta fight the lion. That's what that             guy Scott's all about. I know. I've studied him already.But why couldn't you fight a penguin?Fight a rotten penguin?It needn't be a little penguin. It can be the             biggest penguin you've ever seen. An electric penguin, twenty feet             high, with long green tentacles that sting people, and you can stab             it in the wings and the blood can go spurting psssssshhhh in slow             motion.The lion is in the contract.He fights the lion.Where do they have lions?Africa.That's it. Scott's in Africa. As many lions as we             need.Great!He's looking for a pole no one else knows about.             That ties in with the sand. Right. Paint the sand yellow again.             Okay, let's get this show on the road. 'Scott of the Sahara.'Booming out of the pages of history comes a             story of three men and one woman whose courage shocked a generation.See Ensign Oates' frank adult death struggle             with the spine chilling giant electric penguin See Miss Evans pursued by the man eating             roll top writing desk.And now for something completely different.A what?A license for my pet fish, Eric.How did you know my name was Eric?No, no, no! My fish's name is Eric. Eric fish.             He's an halibut.What?He is an halibut.You've got a pet halibut?Yes, I chose him out of thousands. I didn't like             the others, they were all too flat.You must be a loony.I am not a loony. Why should I be tarred with the             epithet 'loony' merely because I have a pet halibut? I've heard tell             that Sir Gerald Nabarro has a pet prawn called Simon   you wouldn't             call him a loony! Furthermore Dawn Pathorpe, the lady showjumper,             had a clam called Stafford, after the late chancellor. Alan Bullock             has two pikes, both called Chris, and Marcel Proust had an 'addock!             So if you're calling the author of 'A la recherche de temps perdu' a             loony, I shall have to ask you to step outside!All right, all right, all right. A license?Yes!For a fish.Yes!You *are* a loony.Look, it's a bleeding pet, isn't it? I've got a             license for me pet dog Eric, I've got a license for me pet cat Eric.You don't need a license for your cat.I bleedin' well do and I've got one! Can't be             caught out there!There is no such thing as a bloody Cat license.Yes there is.No there isn't.Is!Isn't!Is!Isn't!Is!Isn't!Is!Isn't!Is!Isn't!Is!Isn't!What's that then?This is a dog license with the word 'dog' crossed             out and 'cat' written in in crayon.Man didn't have the right form.What man?The man from the cat detector van.The loony detector van, you mean.Look, it's people like you what cause unrest.What cat detector van?The cat detector van from the Ministry of             Housinge.Housinge?It was spelt like that on the van. I'm very             observant. I never seen so many bleedin' aerials. The man said their             equipment could pinpoint a purr at four hundred yards, and Eric             being such a happy cat was a piece of cake.How much did you pay for this?Sixty quid and eight for the fruit bat.What fruit bat?Eric the fruit bat.Are all your pets called Eric?There's nothing so odd about that. Kemel Attaturk             had an entire menagerie called Abdul.No he didn't.Did!Didn't!Did, did, did, did, did and did!Oh all right.Spoken like a gentleman, sir. Now, are you going             to give me a fish license?I promise you that there is no such thing. You             don't need one.The TV Version continues..the album version             continues belowThen I would like a statement to that effect             signed by the Lord Mayor.You're in luck.********** TV Version finishes   continuation             of album version **********In that case give me a bee license.A license for your pet bee.Correct.Called Eric? Eric the bee?No.No?No, Eric the half bee. He had an accident.You're off your chump.Look, if you intend by that utilization of an             obscure colloquialism to imply that my sanity is not up to scratch,             or even to deny the semi existence of my little chum Eric the half             bee, I shall have to ask you to listen to this.

But can a bee be said to be            Or not to be an entire bee            When half the bee is not a bee            Due to some ancient injury?SingingLa dee dee, one two three,            Eric the half a bee.

Tonight's other             outstanding match was the semi final between the Bournemouth             Gynecologists and the Watford Long John Silver Impersonators. We             bring you edited highlights of the match.Well, that's about it for tonight ladies and             gentlemen, but remember if you've enjoyed watching the show just             half as much as we've enjoyed doing it, then we've enjoyed it twice             as much as you.

Poor daddyLooks like I shan't be catching the 11.30 now.Oh no, John, you mustn't miss your train.How could I think of catching a train when I should             be here helping you?Oh, John, thank you anyway you could always             catch the 9.30 tomorrow   it goes via Caterham and Chipstead.Or the 9.45's even better.Oh, but you'd have to change at Lambs Green.Yes, but there's only a seven minute wait now.Oh, yes, of course, I'd forgotten it was Friday.             Oh, who could have done this.Oh, do hurry Sir Horace, your train leaves             in twenty eight minutes, and if you miss the 10.15 you won't catch             the 3.45 which means  oh!I'm afraid Sir Horace won't be catching the 10.15,             Lady Partridge.Has he been ?Yes   after breakfast.Lady Partridge, I'm afraid you can cancel his seat             reservation.Oh, and it was back to the engine   fourth             coach along so that he could see the gradient signs outside             Swanborough.Not any more Lady Partridge the line's been             closed.Closed! Not Swanborough!I'm afraid so.All fight, nobody move. I'm Inspector Davis of             Scotland Yard.My word, you were here quickly, inspector.Yeah, I got the 8.55 Pullman Express from             King's Cross and missed that bit around Hornchurch.It's a very good train.Excellent, very good, delightful.Hello everyone.Tony!Yes, after breakfast.Then  he won't be needing his reservation on the             10.15.Exactly.And I suppose as his eldest son it must go to me.Just a minute, Tony There's a small matter             of murder.Oh, but surely he simply shot himself and then hid             the gun.How could anyone shoot himself and then             hide the gun without first cancelling his reservation.Ha, ha! Well, I must dash or I'll be late for the             10.15.I suggest yOu murdered your father for his seat             reservation.I may have had the motive, inspector, but I could             not have done it, for I have only just arrived from Gillingham on             the 8.13 and here's my restaurant car ticket to prove it.The 8. 13 from Gillingham doesn't have a             restaurant car.It's a standing buffet only.Oh, er did I say the 8.13, I meant the 7.58             stopping train.But the 7.58 stopping train arrived at             Swindon at 8.19 owing to annual point maintenance at Wisborough             Junction.So how did you make the connection with the 8. I3             which left six minutes earlier?Oh, er, simple! I caught the 7.16 Football Special             arriving at Swindon at 8.09.But the 7.16 Football Special only stops at             Swindon on alternate Saturdays.Yes, surely you mean the Holidaymaker             Special.Oh, yes! How daft of me. Of course I came on the             Holidaymaker Special calling at Bedford, Colmworth, Fen Dinon,             Sutton, Wallington and Gillingham.That's Sundays only!Damn. All fight, I confess I did it. I killed him             for his reservation, but you won't take me alive! I'm going to throw             myself under the 10.12 from Reading.Don't be a fool, Tony, don't do it, the 10.12 has             the new narrow traction bogies, you wouldn't stand a chance.Exactly.That was an excerpt from the latest West End             hit 'It all happened on the 11.20 from Hainault to Redhill via             Horsham and Reigate, calling at Carshalton Beeches, Malmesbury,             Tooting Bec, and Croydon West'. The author is Mr. Neville Shunt.typing Chuff, chuff, chuffwoooooch, woooooch!             Sssssssss, sssssssss! Diddledum, diddledum, diddlealum. Toot, toot.             The train now standing at platform eight, tch, tch, tch, diddledum,             diddledum. Chuffff chuffffiTff eeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaa Vooooommmmm.Some people have made the mistake of seeing             Shunt's work as a load of rubbish about railway timetables, but             clever people like me, who talk loudly in restaurants, see this as a             deliberate ambiguity, a plea for understanding in a mechanized             world. The points are frozen, the beast is dead. What is the             difference? What indeed is the point? The point is frozen, the beast             is late out of Paddington. The point is taken. If La Fontaine's elk             would spurn Tom Jones the engine must be our head, the dining car             our oesophagus, the guard's van our left lung, the cattle truck our             shins, the first class compartment the piece of skin at the nape of             the neck and the level crossing an electric elk called Simon. The             clarity is devastating. But where is the ambiguity? It's over there             in a box. Shunt is saying the 8.15 from Gillingham when in reality             he means the 8.13 from Gillingham. The train is the same only the             time is altered. Ecce homo, ergo elk. La Fontaine knew his sister             and knew her bloody well. The point is taken, the beast is molting,             the fluff gets up your nose. The illusion is complete; it is             reality, the reality is illusion and the ambiguity is the only             truth. But is the truth, as Hitchcock observes, in the box? No there             isn't room, the ambiguity has put on weight. The point is taken, the             elk is dead, the beast stops at Swindon, Chabrol stops at nothing,             I'm having treatment and La Fontaine can get knotted.Gavin Millar rrrrrrr was not talking to Neville Shunt. From the world             of the theatre we turn to the world of dental hygiene. No, no, no,             no. From the world of the theatre we move to the silver screen.

Martin Curry talking to Matthew Palate Padget.Martin Curry, welcome. One of the big teeth big             points that the American critics made about your latest film, 'The             Twelve Caesars', was that it was on so all embracing a topic. What             made you undertake so enormous a tusk task?Well I've always been interested in Imperial Rome             from Julius Caesar right through to Vethpathian.Who?Vethpathian.Ah! Vespasian.Yes.When I saw your film it did seem to me that you             had taken a rather, urn, subjective approach to it.I'm sorry?Well, I mean all your main characters had these             enormous  well not enormous, these very big  well let's have a             look at a clip in which Julius Incisor . Caesar talks to his             generals during the baffle against Caractacus.I don't see that at all.Martin Curry, why do all your characters have             these very big er  very big um  teeth?What do you mean?Well, I mean, er and even in your biblical             epic, 'The Son of Man', John the Baptist had the most enormous              dental appendages  and of course  himself had the most             monumental ivories.Oh, a straw, yes, yes. Well while we're doing that             perhaps we could take another look at an earlier film, 'Trafalgar'.Cover my coat, Mr. Bush, the men must not know of             this till victory is ours.The surgeon's coming, sir.No, tell the surgeon to attend the men that can be             saved.

Mrs. Smegma will you stand up please.Mr. Ken Andrews, of Leighton Road, Slough has             concealed himself extremely well. He could be almost anywhere. He             could be behind the wall, inside the water barrel, beneath a pile of             leaves, up in the tree, squatting down behind the car, concealed in             a hollow, or crouched behind any one of a hundred bushes. However we             happen to know he's in the water barrel.Mr. and Mrs. Watson of Ivy Cottage, Worplesdon             Road, Hull, chose a very cunning way of not being seen. When we             called at their house, we found that they had gone away on two weeks             holiday. They had not left any forwarding address, and they had             bolted and barred the house to prevent us from getting in.

It is well known that we now have the problem             relatively under control, and that it is the RAF who now suffer the             largest casualties in this area. And what do you think the Argylls             ate in Aden. Arabs? Yours etc. Captain B.J. Smethwick in a white             wine sauce with shallots, mushrooms and garlic.Yup, that's right, what can I do for you,             squire?Um, well, I wonder if you can help me. My mother has             just died and I'm not quite sure what I should do.Ah, well, we can 'elp you. We deal with             stiffs.Yea. Now there's three things we can do with             your mum. We can bury her, burn her, or dump her.Dump her?Dump her in the Thames.Oh, did you like her?Yes!Oh well, we won't dump her, then. Well, what             do you think burn her, or bury her?Um, well, um, which would you recommend?Well they're both nasty. If we burn her, she             gets stuffed in the flames, crackle, crackle, crackle, which is a             bit of a shock if she's not quite dead. But quick. And then you get             a box of ashes, which you can pretend are hers.Or, if you don't wanna fry her, you can bury             her. And then she'll get eaten up by maggots and weevils, nibble,             nibble, nibble, which isn't so hot if, as I said, she's not quite             dead.I see. Um. Well, I.. I.. I.. I'm not very sure. She's             definitely dead.Where is she?In the sack.Let's 'ave a look.Umm, she looks quite young.Yes, she was.I THINK WE'VE GOT AN EATER!I'll get the oven on!Um, erexcuse me, um, are you are you suggesting             we should eat my mother?Actually, I do feel a bit peckish   No! NO, I can't!Look, we'll eat your mum. Then, if you feel a             bit guilty about it afterwards, we can dig a grave and you can throw             up into it.All right.Michael Norman Randall, you have been found guilty             of the murder of Arthur Reginald Webster, Charles Patrick             Trumpington, Marcel Agnes Bernstein, Lewis Anona Rudd, John Malcolm             Kerr, Nigel Sinclair Robinson, Norman Arthur Potter, Felicity Jayne             Stone, Jean Paul Reynard, Rachel Shirley Donaldson, Stephen Jay             Greenblatt, Karl Heinz Mullet, Belinda Anne Ventham, Juan Carlos             Fernandez, Thor Olaf Stensgaard, Lord Kimberrley of Pretoria, Lady             Kimberley of Pretoria, The Right Honourable Nigel WarmsIcy             Kimberley, Robert Henry Noonan and Felix James Bennett, on or about             the morning of the 19th December 1972.

And yet their             epic journey in EBW 343 has set them alongside Thor Heyerdahl and             Sir Edmund Hillary. Starting only with a theory, Mr. Norris set out             to prove that the inhabitants of Hounslow could have been             descendants of the people of Surbiton who had made the great trek             north. No newcomer to this field, Mr. Norris's 'A Short History of             Motor Traffic Between Parley and Esher' had become a best selling             minor classic in the car swapping belt.Firstly, the similarity of the houses. Secondly, the similarity             of the costume between Hounslow and Surbiton,and thirdly, the similarity of speech.Are you still running the GDBDMDB?Yes, but I've had the excess nipples woppled             to remove tamping.Jolly good.Were these just coincidences, or were they, as             Mr. Norris believed, part of an identical cultural background? One             further discovery convinced him.The lawnmower. Surely such a gadget could not have been generated             independently in two separate areas. Mr. Norris was convinced.I'm convinced.But how to prove it.But how to prove it.There was only one way to see if the journey             between Surbiton and Hounslow was possible, and that was to try and             make it. Months of preparation followed whilst Mr. Norris continued             his research in the Putney Public Library,and Mrs. Norris made sandwiches.Finally, by April, they were ready. On the             23rd, Mr. and Mrs. Norris set out from 'Abide A Wee' to motor the             fifteen miles to Surbiton, watched by a crowd of local well wishers.That evening they dined at Tooting.This would be the last they'd see of civilization. Mr. Norris's             diary for the 23rd reveals the extraordinary calmness and deep inner             peacefulness of his mind.7.30 Fed cat. 8.00 Breakfast. 8.30 Yes             successfully. 9.00 Set out on historic journey.On the morning of the 24th, early to avoid the             traffic, Mr. Norris's historic expedition set out from Surbiton               destination Hounslow. Early on they began to perceive encouraging             signs.The writing on the sign was almost exactly the same as the             writing in the AA book. They were on the right route. During the             long hours of the voyage, Mr. Norris's wife Betty kept a complete             photographic record and made sandwiches. This is some of the unique             footage which Mrs. Norris got back from the chemistsMile succeeded mile and the terrific strain was beginning to tell             when suddenly,by an amazing stroke of luck, Mr. Norris had come across the             Kingston by pass. This was something to tell the Round Table.Could this have been the method used? Hardly daring to believe,             Mr. Norris led his expedition on to the 3.47.Hounslow.Was this, then, the final proof? Something aroused the             accountant's instinct buried deep in Mr. Norris's make up.The journey was possible, and yet .'Wrong Way' Norris had accidentally stumbled on a piece of             anthropological history. It was the inhabitants of Hounslow who had             made the great trek south to the sunnier pastures of Surbiton, and             not vice versa, as he had originally surmised. This was the secret             of Surbiton! Happy and contented Mr. Norris returned to the calmer             waters of chartered accountancy, for, in his way, 'Wrong Way' Norris             was right.'THE END'It was Tidwell's idea, sir.Shut up, Stebbins!

His father             Leo McKern, a free lance bishop, was married to Vern Plachenka             Julie Christie but secretly deeply in love with Margo Farenka             Shirley Abicair and the strangely flatulent Madame Ranevsky             Norris McWhirter. Soon, however, the family Eldridge Cleaver,             Moira Lister and Stan the Bat moved to the neighboring industrial             village of Omsk Eddie Waring where they soon found themselves,             sadly, quite unable to cope Anthony Barber. In i863, however,             Tchaikovsky was sent to Moscow to study the piano and, when he'd             finished that, the living room. Maurice takes up the story.Well, guess what, the very next thing he did was             to go to this extraordinary but extraordinary duckety poos             semi Mondrian house in Robin Russia. Here Tommy Tchaikovsky wrote             some of the most Sammy super symphonies you've ever Henry heard in             the whole of your Lily life.'A FAMOUS MUSIC CRITIC AND HAIRDRESSER'She was such a good composer that everybody, but             everybody, wanted to know, and quite right too, because she wrote             some lovely bits, such as Sally Sleeping Beauty, Poesy Pathetique,             Adrian 1812 and lots of Conny concerti for Vera violin and Peter             Piano Fanny Forte.But what do we really know of this             tortured ponce?Well, if you can imagine the size of             Nelson's Column, which is roughly three times the size of a London             bus, then Tchaikovsky was much smaller. His head was about the same             size as that of an extremely large dog, that is to say, two very             small dogs, or four very large hamsters, or one medium size rabbit             if you count the whole of the body and not just the head. Robin.Peter.Simon.Maurice.Me. Well, poor pet, she was like a lost lamb in             an abattoir. Eventually she Dickie died of Colin Cholera in St Patsy             Petersburg, in Gettie great Percy pain.Here to play Tchaikovsky's first piano             concerto in B Flat Minor is the world famous soloist Sviatoslav             Richter.

I'm a merchant banker.How do you do MrEr I forget my name for the moment but I am             a merchant banker.Well I don't want to show my hand too early,             but actually here at Slater Nazi we are quite keen to get into             orphans, you know, developing market and all that what son of sum             did you have in mind?Well er you're a rich man.Yes, I am. Yes. Yes, very very rich. Quite             phenomenally wealthy. Yes, I do own the most startling quantifies of             cash. Yes, quite right you're rather a smart young lad aren't             you. We could do with somebody like you to feed the pantomime horse.             Very smart.Thank you, sir.Now, you were saying. I'm very, very, very,             very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very rich.So er, how about a pound?A pound. Yes, I see. Now this loan would be             secured by theIt's not a loan, sir.What?It's not a loan.Ah.It's a bit small for a share certificate isn't             it? Look, I think I'd better run this over to our legal department.             If you could possibly pop back on Friday.Well do you have to do that, couldn't you just             give me the pound?Yes, but you see I don't know what it's for.It's for the orphans.Yes?It's a gift.A what?A gift?Oh a gift!Yes.A tax dodge.No, no, no, no.No? Well, I'm awfully sorry I don't understand.             Can you just explain exactly what you want.Well, I want you to give me a pound, and then I             go away and give it to the orphans.Yes?Well, that's it.No, no, no, I don't follow this at all, I mean,             I don't want to seem stupid but it looks to me as though I'm a pound             down on the whole deal.Well, yes you are.I am! Well, what is my incentive to give you             the pound?Well the incentive is   to make the orphans             happy.Yes, lots of people give me money.What, just like that?Yes.Must be sick. I don't suppose you could give me             a list of their names and addresses could you?No, I just go up to them in the street and ask.Oh, thank you, sir.The only trouble is, you gave me the idea             before I'd given you the pound. And that's not good business.Isn't it?Now I've asked you to Now I've asked you Shut up!Now I've asked you in here to see me this morning because I'm             afraid we're going to have to let one of you go.I'm very sorry but the present rationalization of this firm makes             it inevitable that we hive one of you off.Now you may think that this is very harsh behavior but let me             tell you that our management consultants actually queried the             necessity for us to employ  a pantomime horse at all.And so the decision has to be made which one of you is to go.             Champion how many years have you been with this firm?Trigger?I see. Well, it's a difficult decision. But in accordance with             our traditional principles of free enterprise and healthy             competition I'm going to ask the two of you to fight to the death             for it.No, I'm afraid there's no redundancy scheme.In the hard and unrelenting world of nature the ceaseless             struggle for survival continues.This time one of the pantomime horses concedes defeat and so             lives to fight another day.Here, in a colony of sea lions, we see a huge bull sea lion             seeing off an intruding bull who is attempting to intrude on his             harem. This pattern of aggressive behavior is typical of these             documentaries.Here we see two limpets locked in a life or death struggle for             territory. The huge bull limpet, enraged by the rock, endeavors to             encircle its sprightly opponent.Here we see an ant. This ant is engaged in a life or death             struggle with the wolf. You can see the ant creeping up on the wolf             on all sixes.Now he stops to observe. Satisfied that the wolf has not heard             him, he approaches nearer. With great skill he chooses his moment             and then, quick as a limpet, with one mighty boundburies his fangs in the wolf's neck. The wolf struggles to no             avail. A battle of this kind can take anything up to fifteen years             because the timber ant has such a tiny mouth.Here we see Heinz Sielmann engaged in a life or death struggle             with Peter Scott. They are engaged in a bitter punch up over repeat             fees on the overseas sales of their nature documentaries.Now they have been joined by an enraged Jacques Cousteau. This is             typical of the harsh and bitchy world of television features.Here we see a honey bear not engaged in a life or death struggle             about anything. These honey bears are placid and peaceful creatures             and consequently bad television.Here we see a pantomime horse. It is engaged in a life or death             struggle for a job with a merchant bank. However, his rival             employee, the huge bull pantomime horse, is lying in wait for him.Poor pantomime horse.Here we see a pantomime goose engaged in a life or death struggle             with Terence Rattigan.The enraged goose fires.Poor Terence. Another victim of this silly film.Here we see an enraged pantomime Princess Margaret, she is lying             in wait for her breakfast.The unsuspecting breakfast glides over closer to its doom. The             enraged pantomime royal person is poised for the kill. She raises             her harpoon and fires.Pang! Right in the toast. A brief struggle and all is over. Poor             breakfast! Another victim of the. aargh!Sketch just starting, actor wanted.Good morning.Morning, sir.I'd like to join the army please.I see, sir. Short service or long service commission,             sir?As long as possible please.Right well I'll just take a few particulars and             thenThe Women's Royal Army Corps, sir?Yes. I was just thinking, you know, if it was             possible for me to have my choice  I'd prefer to be in the             Women's Royal Amy Corps.Well, I'm afraid that the people that recruit here             normally go straight into the Scots Guards.Which is all men I suppose?Yes it is.Yes. Are there any regiments which are more             effeminate than others?Well, no sir. I mean, apart from the Marines,             they're all dead butch.You see, what I really wanted was a regiment             where I could be really quiet and have more time to myself m work             with fabrics, and creating new concepts in interior design.Working with fabrics and experimenting with             interior design!Yes.Oh well you want the Durham Light Infantry then,             sir.Oh.Oh yes. That's the only regiment that's really             doing something new with interior design, with color, texture, line             and that.I see.Oh yes, I mean their use of color with fabrics is             fantastic. I saw their pattern book the other day   beautiful,             beautiful. Savage tans, great slabs of black, set against aggressive             orange. It really makes you want to shout out, this is good! This is             real!Really?Oh yes. I mean the Inniskillin Fusiliers and the             Anglian Regiment are all right if you're interested in the art             nouveau William Morris revival bit, but if you really want a             regiment of the line that is really saying something about interior             decor, then you've got to go for the Durham Light Infantry.Oh, I've had enough of this. I'm handing in my             notice.What do you mean?Well I 'mean, when I applied for this job I             thought I'd get a few decent lines but you end up doing the whole             thing. I mean my last five speeches have been 'really, really   I             see   I see' and 'really'. I wouldn't give those lines to a dog.All right, all right, all right, sonny. I'll tell             you what. We'll do something different. I'll be a bus conductor, and             you can be a really funny passenger on a bus.Fivepenny please.Look!I am looking   it's the only way I keep my eyelids             apart! Boom boom! Every one a Maserati!Look! You said I was going to be a funny             passenger.I mean, all I said was, fivepenny please, You             can't call that a funny line.Well it's the way you said it.No it isn't. Nobody can say 'fivepenny please'             and make it funny.Fivepenny please.Morning.Not so warm today, George.Good morning.Good morning.Voice Good morning.Come in, Mr. Horton.Morning, sir.Thank you, sir.'THE STORY OF HOLLAND'S MOST FAMOUS APERITIF''THE END'Hello.Hello, I'm another announcer, my name's Dick.

The mountain with the biggest tits in the world.Start again!Well, people keep taking your hairdryer on             every turn.There's a lot of bitching in the tents.You couldn't get near the mirror.The leader of the expedition was Colonel Sir             John Cheesy Weezy Butler, veteran K2, Annapurna, and Vidal. His plan             was to ignore the usual route around the south and to make straight             for the top.We established Base Salon here, and climbed quite             steadily up to Mario's, here. From here, using crampons and cutting             ice steps as we went, we moved steadily up the face to the north             ridge, establishing Camp Three, where we could get a hot meal, a             manicure, and a shampoo and set.Could it work? Could this 18 year old             hairdresser from Brixton succeed where others had failed? The             situation was complicated by the imminent arrival of the monsoon             storms. Patrice takes up the story.Well, we knew as well as anyone that the monsoons             were due. But the thing was, Ricky and I had just had a blow dry and             rinse, and we couldn't go out for a couple of days.After a blazing row, the Germans and Italians             had turned back, taking with them the last of the hairnets. On the             third day, a blizzard blew up. Temperatures fell to minus 30 degrees             centigrade. Inside the little tent, things were getting desperate.But a new factor had entered the race. A team             of French chiropodists, working with brand new corn plasters and Dr.             Scholl's Mountaineering Sandals, were close behind. The Glasgow             Orpheus male voice choir were tackling the difficult north part. All             together, fourteen expeditions were at the scene. This was it. Ricky             had to make a decision.Well, he decided to open a salon.It was a tremendous success.Hello, is that the fire brigade?No, sorry, wrong number.That phone's not stopped ringing all day.What happens when you've mixed the batter,             do you dice the ham with the coriander?No, no, you put them in separately when the             vine leaves are ready.Oh, no, not again.Take it off the hook.I can't get the fire brigade Mervyn.Here, let me try, dear. You go and play the cello.Oh it doesn't do any good, dear.Look. Do you want the little hamster to live or             not?Yes I do, Mervyn.Well go and play the cello!What?He's slipped away.What?The sodding hamster's dead!Some Mozart concertos, dear.What How did he ?His eyes just closed, and he fell into the             wastepaper basket. I've covered him with a copy of the 'Charlie             George Football Book'.There was nothing we could do, Mervyn. If             we'd have had the whole Philharmonic Orchestra in there, he'd still             have gone.I'm going upstairs, I can't bear it.No, he doesn't want anyone at the moment,             thank you. No, yes, yes, no thank you for trying, yes, yes,  no,             Saxones, yes, yes thank you, bye, bye.Mummy,Well, things is pretty bad there at the moment but             there does seem some hope of a constitutional settlement.Oh don't talk. Let me just look at you,Great to be home, mummy. How are you?Oh, I'm fine. I must just go upstairs and get             your room ready.It's a bungalow, mummy.Oh dam, yes. Mervyn, Mervyn   look who's             here, it's our Eamonn come back to see us.Hello, Eamonn.Hello, Merv.How was Dublin?Well as I was telling mummy here, things is pretty             bad there at the moment but there does seem some hope of a             constitutional settlement.Oh no, Thursday's the Industrial Relations             Bill Dinner Dance. Can't they make it another day?And so it was the fire brigade eventually came             round on Friday night.Oh, so glad you could come. What would you             like to drink? Gin and tonic? Sherry?Well, how was Dublin, Eamonn?Well, as I was telling mummy and Mervyn earlier,             things is pretty bad there at the moment but there does seem some             hope of a constitutionalTHE BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION            IN ASSOCIATION WITH TRANSWORLD INTERNATIONAL            AND NIMROD PRODUCTIONS PRESENT            AN ARTHUR E.

This week I'm going to tell you what to do if there is an armed             communist uprising near your home when you're having a party. Well             obviously it'll depend how far you've got with your party when the             signal for Red Revolt is raised. If you're just having preliminary             aperitifs   Dubonnet, a sherry or a sparkling white wine   then the             guests will obviously be in a fairly formal mood and it will be             difficult to tell which are the communist agitators. So the thing to             do is to get some cloth and some bits of old paper, put it down on             the floor and shoot everybody. This will deal with the Red Menace on             your own doorstep. If you're having canapés, as I showed you last             week, or an outdoor barbecue, then the thing to do is set fire to             all houses in the street. This will stir up anti communist hatred             and your neighbors will be right with you as you organize             counter revolutionary terror. So you see, if you act promptly .             enough, any left wing uprising can be dealt with by the end of the             party. ByeERIC Bleck people. Bleck people.             Rrrhodesian.

What's the point of going abroad if you're             just another tourist carted around in buses surrounded by sweaty             mindless oafs from Kettering and Coventry in their cloth caps and             their cardigans and their transistor radios and their Sunday             Mirrors, complaining about the tea   Oh they don't make it properly             here, do they, not like at home   and stopping at Majorcan bodegas             selling fish and chips and Watney's Red Barrel and calamari's and             two veg and sitting in their cotton frocks squirting Timothy White's             sun cream all over their puffy raw swollen purulent flesh 'cos they             overdid it on the first day.And being herded into endless Hotel Miramars and             Bellvueses and Continentales with their modern international luxury             roomettes and draught Red Barrel and swimming pools full of fat             German businessmen pretending they're acrobats forming pyramids and             frightening the children and barging into queues and if you're not             at your table spot on seven you miss the bowl of Campbell's Cream of             Mushroom soup, the first item on the menu of International Cuisine,             and every Thursday night the hotel has a bloody cabaret in the bar,             featuring a tiny emaciated dago with nine inch hips and some bloated             fat tart with her hair brylcreemed down and a big arse presenting             Flamenco for Foreigners.And then some adenoidal typists from Birmingham             with flabby white legs and diarrhea trying to pick up hairy             bandy legged wop waiters called Manuel and once a week there's an             excursion to the local Roman Remains to buy cherryade and melted ice             cream and bleeding Watney's Red Barrel and one evening you visit the             so called typical restaurant with local color and atmosphere and             you sit next to a party from Rhyl who keep singing Torremolinos,             torremolinos and complaining about the food   It's so greasy isn't             it?   and you get cornered by some drunken greengrocer from Luton             with an Instamatic camera and Dr. Scholl sandals and last Tuesday's             Daily Express and he drones on and on about how Mr. Smith should be             running this country and how many languages Enoch Powell can speak             and then he throws up over the Cuba Libres.Will you be quiet pleaseAnd sending tinted postcards of places they don't             realize they haven't even visited to All at number 22, weather             wonderful, our room is marked with an 'X'.Shut upFood very greasy but we've found a charming             little local place hidden away in the back streetsShut up!where they serve Watney's Red Barrel and cheese             and onion.Shut up your bloody gob.crisps and the accordionist plays 'Maybe it's             because I'm a Londoner'. And spending four days on the tarmac at             Luton airport on a five day package tour with nothing to eat but             dried BEA type sandwiches and you can't even get a drink of Watney's             Red Barrel because you're still in England and the bloody bar closes             every time you're thirsty and there's nowhere to sleep and the kids             are crying and vomiting and breaking the plastic ash trays and they             keep telling you it'll only be another hour although your plane is             still in Iceland and has to take some Swedes to Yugoslavia before it             can load you up at 3 a.m. in the bloody morning and you sit on the             tarmac till six because of unforeseen difficulties, i.e. the             permanent strike of Air Traffic Control in Paris   and nobody can go             to the lavatory until you take off at 8, and when you get to Malaga             airport everybody's swallowing enterovioform and queuing for the             toilets and queuing for the armed customs officers, and queuing for             the bloody bus that isn't there to take you to the hotel that hasn't             yet been finished. And when you finally get to the half built             Algerian ruin called the Hotel del Sol by paying half your holiday             money to a licensed bandit in a taxi you find there's no water in             the pool, there's no water in the taps, there's no water in the bog             and there's only a bleeding lizard in the bidet. And half the rooms             are double booked and you can't sleep anyway because of the             permanent twenty four hour drilling of the foundations of the hotel             next door   and you're plagued by appalling apprentice chemists from             Ealing pretending to be hippies, and middle class stockbrokers'             wives busily buying identical holiday villas in suburban development             plots just like Esher, in case the Labour government gets in again,             and fat American matrons with sloppy buttocks and Hawaiian patterned             ski pants looking for any mulatto male who can keep it up long             enough when they finally let it all flop out. And the Spanish             Tourist Board promises you that the raging cholera epidemic is             merely a case of mild Spanish tummy, like the previous outbreak of             Spanish tummy in 1660 which killed half London and decimated Europe               and meanwhile the bloody Guardia are busy arresting             sixteen year olds for kissing in the streets and shooting anyone             under nineteen who doesn't like Franco. And then on the last day in             the airport lounge everyone's comparing sunburns, drinking Nasty             Spumante, buying cartons of duty free cigarillos and using up             their last pesetas on horrid dolls in Spanish National costume and             awful straw donkeys and bullfight posters with your name on             Ordoney, El Cordobes and Brian Pules of Norwich and 3 D pictures             of the Pope and Kennedy and Franco, and everybody's talking about             coming again next year and you swear you never will although there             you are tumbling bleary eyed out of a tourist tight antique Iberian             airplaneGood evening.

Oh! Oh! What is my theory?Yes!The Theory, by A.

That             is the theory that I have and which is mine and what it is, too.That's it, is it?Right, Chris!Well, Anne, this theory of yours seems to have             hit the nail right on the head. and it's mine.Thank you for coming along to the studio.My pleasure, Chris.Britain's newest wasp farmIt's been a lot of funopened last weeksaying what my theory is Yes, thank you.and whose it is.Yes. opened last weekI have another theory.Not today, thank you.Look!

Your commentator as usual is Edna             O'Brien.George.Yes, Gladys.There's a man at the door with a moustache.He says do we want a documentary on mollusks.Mollusks!Yes.What's he mean, mollusks?MOLLUSKS!! GASTROPODS! LAMELLIBRANCHS!             CEPHALOPODS!It's free.Ooh! Where does he want us to sit?Not very interesting is it?What?I was talking to him.Dreadful isn't it?What?I was talking to him.Switch him off.Switching you off.Why, don't you like it?Oh it's dreadful.Embarrassing.Is it?Yes, it's perfectly awful.Disgraceful! I don't know how they've got the             nerve to put it on.It's so boring.Well  it's not much of a subject is it  be             fair.What do you think, George?Give him another twenty seconds.Anyway the majority of the mollusks are included in             three large groups, the gastropods, the lamellibranchs and the             cephalopodsHowever, what is more interesting, er  is the             mollusk's er  sex life.Yes, the mollusk is a randy little fellow whose             primitive brain scarcely strays from the subject of the you know             what.Ought not to be allowed.The randiest of the gastropods is the limpet. This             hot blooded little beast with its tent like shell is always on the             job. Its extra marital activities are something startling. Frankly I             don't know how the female limpet finds the time to adhere to the             rock face. How am I doing?Disgusting.But more interesting.Oh yes, tch, tch, tch.Another loose living gastropod is the periwinkle.             This shameless little libertine with its characteristic ventral             locomotion  is not the marrying kind Anywhere anytime is its             motto. Up with the shell and they're at it.How about the lamellibranchs?Have you got one?Let's kill it. Disgusting.That'll teach it. Well thank you for a very             interesting program.Oh, not at all.

I'll start again. The             activity you see behind me is part of the preparations for the new             Naval Expedition to Lake Pahoe.

Yes, that's             right, 22A.Runcorn Avenue?Yes, it's just by Blenheim Crescent do you             know it?You mean it's in an ordinary street?Of course it's not an ordinary street! It's got             a lake in it!Yes but ILook, how many streets do you know that have got             lakes in them?But you mean is it very large?I'm now standing in Runcorn Avenue. Sir John              where exactly is the lake?Er, well let's see, that's 18 that's 20 so             this must be the one.Er, excuse meYes, that's the one all right.But it's an ordinary house.Look, I'm getting pretty irritated with this             line of questioning.But it doesn't even look like a lakeLook, your whole approach since this interview             started has been to mock the Navy. When I think that it was for the             likes of you that I had both my legs blown offGood morning   I'm looking for a Lake Pahoe.There's a Mr. Padgett.No, no a lake.There's no lake here, mate. This is Runcorn Avenue.             What's the camera doing?He's looking for a lake.Lake Pahoe.Oh, you want downstairs, 22A the basement.Ah! Thank you very much. Good morning. Come on             men, downstairs.Were you successful, Sir John?It's in the basement.In the basement?Pieces of eight.Hello.Ooooh. I think' it's someone about the damp.Hello.Tell 'em about the bleeding rats, too.Good morning, is this Lake Pahoe?Well, I don't know about that, but it's bleeding             damp. Are you from the council?No. We are the official British Naval Expedition             to this lake. May we come in?Hang on.Bloody sharks.Get in.Well um that would appear to be the end of             the expedition.The Magna Cana   was it a document signed at             Runnymede in 1215 by King John pledging independence to the English             barons, or was it a piece of chewing gum on a bedspread in Dorset?             The latter idea is the brainchild of a man new to the field of             historical research. Mr. Badger, why   why are you on this program?But why Dorset?Well, I have for a long time been suffering from a             species of brain injury which I incurred during the rigors of             childbirth, and I'd like to conclude by putting my finger up my             nose.Mr. Badger, I think you're the silliest             person we've ever had on this program, and so I'm going to ask you             to have dinner with me.'LATER THE SAME SKETCH'My wife Maureen ran off with a bottle of Bell's             whisky during the Aberdeen versus Raith Rovers match which ended in             a goalless draw. Robson particularly, in goal, had a magnificent             first half, his fine positional sense preventing the build up of any             severe pressure on the suspect Aberdeen defense.

Under normal circumstances I would have             asked a policeman or a minister of the Church, but finding no one             available, I thought it better to consult a man with some             qualifications, rather than rely on the possibly confused testimony             of a passer by.Thank you.Sept 2nd.

There is no need to panic.There's bomb on board this plane, and I'll tell             you where it is for a thousand pounds.I don't believe you.If you don't tell me where the bomb is if I             don't give you the money Unless you give me the bombThe money.The money, thank you, pretty lady the bomb will             explode killing everybody.Including you.I'll tell you where it is for a pound.Here's a pound.I don't want Scottish money. They've got the             numbers. It can be traced.One English pound. Now where's the bomb?I can't remember.You've forgotten.Now where's the bomb?It's in the luggage compartment.Right. Here's your pound..This character giving you any trouble?He's ruined this sketch.Absolutely.Let's go on to the next one.'Wait a tic, wait a tic. No. I won't ruin your             sketch for a pound.No, no.75P.Well I see my role in it as, er, how can I put             it best   the nude man   as sort of symbolizing the two separate             strands of existence, the essential nudity of manIt's an interesting question. Personally I             rather adhere to the Bergsonian idea of laughter as a social             sanction against inflexible behavior but excuse me a moment             And nowIt'sThis new housing development in Bristol is one             of the most interesting in the country. It's using a variety of new             techniques shock proof curtain walling, a central high voltage,             self generated electricity source, and extruded acrylic fiberglass             fitments. It's also the first major housing project in Britain to be             built entirely by characters from nineteenth century English             literature.Because sir, it is self generating. Because we             have harnessed here in this box the very forces of life itself. The             very forces that will send Helen running back to beg forgiveness!The on site building techniques involve the             construction of twelve foot walling blocks by a crowd of farmhands             from 'Tess of the D'Urbervilles' supervised by the genial landlady,             Mrs. Jupp, from Samuel Butler's 'Way of All Flesh'.In contrast to the site in Bristol, it's             progress here on Britain's first eighteen level motorway interchange             being built by characters from Milton's 'Paradise Lost'Well, no one really got on. Satan didn't get on             with Eve  er Archangel Gabriel didn't get on with Satan             nobody got on with the Serpent, so now they have to work a rota             forces of good from ten till three, forces of evil three to six.But even more modern building techniques are             being used on an expanding new town site near Peterborough; here the             Amazing Mystico and Janet can put up a block of flats by hypnosis in             under a minute.The local Council here have over fifty             hypnosis induced twenty five storey blocks, put up by El Mystico and             Janet. I asked Mr. Ken Verybigliar the advantages of hypnosis             compared to other building methods.'MR K. V. B. LIAR'But the obvious question is are they safe?'MR CLEMENT ONAN, ARCHITECT TO THE COUNCIL'Of course they're safe. There's absolutely no             doubt about that. They are as ,strong, solid and as safe as any             other building method in this country provided of course people             believe in them.Yes, we received a note from the Council saying             that if we ceased to believe in this building it would fall down.You don't mind living in a figment of another             man's imagination?No, it's much better than where we used to live.Where did you used to live?We had an eighteen roomed villa overlooking Nice.Really, that sounds much better.Oh yes   yes you're right.No, no, no, of course not.Phew, that was close.Well, we're going to kick straight off this week             with our Mortuary Quiz, so have your pens and pencils ready.Turn that radio off and look lively!Oh, it's 'Mortuary Quiz', Mr. WangDon't argue, Battersby.

Huron now has less than twelve hours left to find             British ace Don Roberts. Early this morning he finished combing the             outskirts of Lisbon and now he seems to have staked everything on             one final desperate seek here in the Tagus valley. But Roberts is             over fifteen hundred miles away, and it's beginning to look all             over, bar the shouting.

Well now, sorry about Monterrey.That was a little item entitled Hide and Seek               very anarchic, very effective, not quite my cup of tea, but very             nice for the younger people. Well, the next item the boys have put             together takes place in a sitting room. Sorry it's just a sitting             room, but the bank account's a bit low after the appallingly             expensive production of 'Clothmerle'This is a totally free interruption and no money             has exchanged hands whatever.Gravy?Yes please, dear.Oh dear, that'll be the Cheap Laughs from             next door.Come in.No!

They say it's not only             cruel, vicious and immoral, but also blatantly unfair. The bull is             heavy, violent, abusive and aggressive with four legs and great             sharp teeth, whereas the bull fighter is only a small, greasy             Spaniard. Given this basic inequality what can be done to make             bull fighting safer?

Are they going to             be unobtainable throughout the Universe or merely on Algon itself?.             Professor?'PROFESSOR HERMAN KHAN, DIRECTOR OF THE             INSTITUTE OF SPLIT CROTCH PANTIES'We must remember that Algon is over 75,000             miles wide. The probes come down to this area here and we're really             only getting signals from a radius of only thirty or forty miles             around the probe. Split crotch panties, or indeed any items of what             we scientists call, 'Sexy Underwear' or 'Erotic Lingerie' may be             much more plentiful on other parts of the planet.Professor, you were responsible for finding             Scanty Panties and Golden Goddess High Lift Bras on planets which             were never thought able to sustain life, and now that man has             discovered a new galaxy do you think we're going to see underwear             become even naughtier?Oh naughtier and naughtier.'NO BANANAS ON ALGON'Well so much for that  But of course, the             probe itself has excited a great deal of interest for it contains             uranium based dual transmission cells entirely re charged by solar             radiation, which can take off a bra and panties in less than fifteen             seconds. It is, of course, the first piece of space hardware to be             specially designed to undress ladies, and so there are bound to be             some teething troubles  such as how to cope with the combination             of elastic sided boots and tights.But I think we're getting some pictures now from             Algon itself, and it looks as though  yes! The satellite has             found a bird! The probe has struck crumpet and she looks pretty good             too!

Have you anything a bit more modern, you             know, like a job on the buses, or digging the underground?Oh no, we only have Tudor jobs.That can't be very profitable, can it?Well, you'd be surprised, actually sir. The             Tudor economy's booming, ever since Sir Humphrey Gilbert opened up             the North  west passage to Cathay, and the Cabots' expansion in             Canada, there's been a tremendous surge in exports, and trade with             the Holy Roman Empire is going no, quite right, it's no good at             all.What?It's a dead loss. We haven't put anyone in a             job since 1625.I see.That's all?What?That's all you say?Yes.No, no, we were the tops then. Drake got all             his sailors here. Elizabeth, we supplied the archbishops for her             coronation. Shakespeare started off from here as a temp. Then came             James the First and the bottom fell out of the Tudor jobs. 1603               800 vacancies filled, 1604   40, 1605   none, 1606   none.

Just pile up these             baskets of filth and come with me.The battle raged long and hard, but as night             fell Sidney overcame the Spaniards. 6,000 copies of 'Tits and Bums'             and 4,000 copies of 'Shower Sheila' were seized that day.

What relevance do             penguins have to the furtherance of medical science? Well, strangely             enough quite a lot, a major breakthrough, maybe. It was from such an             unlikely beginning as an unwanted fungus accidentally growing on a             sterile plate that Sir Alexander Fleming gave the world penicillin.             James Watt watched an ordinary household kettle boiling and             conceived the potentiality of steam power. Would Albert Einstein             ever have hit upon the theory of relativity if he hadn't been             clever? All these tremendous leaps forward have been taken in the             dark. Would Rutherford ever have split the atom if he hadn't tried?             Could Marconi have invented the radio if he hadn't by pure chance             spent years working at the problem? Are these amazing breakthroughs             ever achieved except by years and years of unremitting study? Of             course not. What I said earlier about accidental discoveries must             have been wrong. Nevertheless scientists believe that these             penguins, these comic flightless web footed little bastards may             finally unwittingly help man to fathom the uncharted depths of the             human mind. Professor Rosewall of the Laver Institute.'PROF. KEN ROSEWALL'The first thing that Dr Kramer came up with was             that the penguin has a much smaller brain than the man. This             postulate formed the fundamental basis of all his thinking and             remained with him until his death.Now we've taken this theory one stage further.             If we increase the size of the penguin until it is the same height             as the man and then compare the relative brain size, we now find             that the penguin's brain is still smaller. But, and this is the             point, it is larger than it was.'DR PEACHES BARTKOWICZ'For a penguin to have the same size of brain as a             man the penguin would have to be over sixty six feet high.'YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN''DR LEWIS HOAD'These IQ. tests were thought to contain an unfair             cultural bias against the penguin. For example, it didn't take into             account the penguins' extremely poor educational system. To devise a             fairer system of test, a team of our researchers spent eighteen             months in Antarctica living like penguins, and subsequently dying             like penguins   only quicker   proving that the penguin is a clever             little sod in his own environment.Therefore we devised tests to be given to the             penguins in the fourth set  I do beg your pardon, in their own             environment.Net!Shh!What is the next number in this sequence   2,             4, 6. . .The environmental barrier had been removed but             we'd hit another the language barrier. The penguins could not speak             English and were therefore unable to give the answers.

And             the big news this morning that the British boy Boris Rogers has             succeeded in swapping his nine stone Welsh born wife for a Ford             Popular and a complete set of Dickens. Well now, I can see they're             ready at the start and so let's go over now for the start of the             3.30.And first let's catch up with the latest news of the betting.Number 12 Betty Parkinson 7 to 4 on favorite, number 27 Mrs.             Colyer 9 to 4, 5 to 1 bar those.And Mrs. Rogers is the first to show, there she goes into Mr.             Johnson's, and Mrs. Johnson across to Mr. Colyer, followed closely             by Mrs. Casey on the inside. Mrs. Parkinson, number 12, going well             there into Mr. Webster's from the Co op, Mrs. Colyer's making ground             fast after a poor start, she's out of Mr. Casey's into Mr.             Parkinson's, she's a couple of lengths ahead of Mrs. Johnson who's             still not out of Mr. Casey's. Mrs. Penguin and at number 8 Mrs.             Colyer    these two now at the head of the field from Mrs. Brown,             Mrs. Atkins, Mrs. Parkinson, Mrs. Warner and Mrs. Rudd    all still at             Mr. Philips's. Mrs. Penguin making the running now, challenged             strongly by Mrs. Casey, Mrs. Casey coming very fast on the inside,             it's going to be Mrs. Casey coming from behind. Now she's making a             break on the outside, Mrs. Penguin running  and at the line,             it's Mrs. Casey who's got it by a short head from Mrs. Penguin in             second place, Mrs. Parkinson in third, Mrs. Rudd, Mrs. Colyer, Mrs.             Warner and there's Mrs. Griffiths who's remained unswapped.Well, a very exciting race there, and I have with me now the             man who owned and trained the winner, Mrs. Casey    Mr. Casey. Well             done, Jack.Thank you, John.Well, were you at all surprised about this, Jack?No, not really, no she's been going very well in training, and             at Doncaster last week, and I fancy her very strongly for the             Cheltenham weekend.Well, thank you very much indeed, Jack. We must leave you now             because it's time for the team event.Hello, and a very warm welcome from the Tower ballroom suite             at Reading, where there's very little in it, they're neck and             neck, crop and grummit, real rack and saddle, brick and bucket,             horse and tooth, cap and thigh, arse over tip, they're absolutely             birds of a feather, there's not a new pin in it, you couldn't get             a melon between them. Well, now, everything rests on the formation             event and here comes the North West with the Mambo. Maestro, take             it away, please.And now it's time for Rugby League, and highlights of this             afternoon's game between Keighley and Hull Kingston Rovers.And there goes his wife into the scrum. And Hull have got the             heel against the head. Doing nicely with this scrum, some very             good picking here. Warrington's picked her up, is he going to let             her go, Wrigley's with him, grand lad is this.Well, that was right on the whistle, Rovers walkin' it there,             winnin' easily by twenty six points to two.Just a reminder that on `Match of the Day' tonight you can see             highlights of two of this afternoon's big games Mrs. Robinson v             Manchester United and Southampton v Mr. Rogers, a rather unusual             game that. And here's a late result Coventry nil, Mr. Johnson's             Una three    Coventry going down at home, there.

That June night, he             and his brother between them washed seventeen square feet of body             area.

There is also a book called 'The Golden Age of Ballooning' published             by the BBC to coincide with the series. It's in an attractive             hand tooled binding, is priced L5 and failure to buy it will make             you liable to a 50 pound fine or three months' imprisonment. There's             also a record of someone reading the book of 'The Golden Age of             Ballooning', a crochet work bedspread with the words 'The Golden Age             of Ballooning' on it, available from the BBC, price 18 pounds or             five months' imprisonment and there are matching toilet seat covers             and courtesy mats with illustrations of many of the balloons             mentioned. Also available is a life size model frog which croaks the             words 'The Golden Age of Ballooning' and an attractive Bakelite case             for storing motorway construction plans in, made in the shape of a             balloon.

No, she wasn't a favorite of             mine. We were out strolling across a fiord one day when one of the             local matadors came out of his tree house and flung a lot of old             scimitars and guillotines out that he'd got cluttering up his wine             cellar and apparently rather a large proportion of them landed on my             wife causing her to snuff it without much more ado.Yes, yes   well lookWhat a rotten ending.Well it is one of our cheapest, sir.What else have you got?Well, there's the long slow pull out, sir, you             know, the camera tracks back and back and mixesNo, have you got anything more exciting?How about a chase?There he is!Oh, no, no, no.Walking into the sunset?What's that one?You know  two lone figures silhouetted             against the dying rays of the setting sun.

Thank God you're safe.No, you wouldn't want that, would you.Why wouldn't I want that?What about summing up from the panel? That's             cheap. You know   the big match experts.Yes. It was quite a good show. I think             that the Michael Ellis character was a little overdone.Well, I don't agree with that, Malcolm,             quite frankly the only bit I liked was this bit with me in it now.No? Slow fade?Nnnn no.Well, how about a sudden ending?Che cosa è lo succiacatori do polli?Morning, squadron leader.What ho, Squiffy.>How was it?Top hole.

We're going to show these Chinese Germans, sir.Sapper Walters, you stand before this             court accused of carrying out the war by other than warlike means                to wit, that you did on April 16th, 1942, dress up as a bag of             dainties, flick wet towels at the enemy during an important             offensive Well, sir Shut up!

Basingstoke in Hampshire?No, no, no, sir, no.I see, carry on.The result of his action was that the enemy Basingstoke where?Basingstoke Westphalia, sir.Oh I see. Carry on.The result of Sapper Walters's action was that             the enemy received wet patches upon their trousers and in some cases             small red strawberry marks upon their thighs I didn't know there was a Basingstoke             in Westphalia.What map?Well, I've certainly never heard of             Basingstoke in Westphalia.What  Southhampton in Westphalia?Yes sir  bricks  clothing.

The Second World War has now entered a sentimental stage. The             morning on the Ardennes Front, the Germans started spooning at dawn,             but the British Fifth Army responded by gazing deep in their eyes,             and the Germans are reported to have gone 'all coy'.When does a dream begin?

JosephIt's just that everywhere I go it's the same old             thing. All anyone wants me to say is `To be or not to be '` that is the question. Whether 'tis             nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous             'Yes. All that sort of thing. And I'm just getting             really fed up.No. I'm sick of it! I want to do something else. I             want to make something of my life.No. I don't know that bit.I want to get away from all that. Be different.Well um  what do you want to be?A private dick!Why do you want to be a private dick?Ooh  why does anyone want to be a private dick?             Fame, money, glamour, excitement, sex!Ah! It's the sex, is it?Well, that's one of the things, yes.Yes, what's the sex problem?Well, there's no problem.Now, come on, come on. You've got the girl             on the bed and she's all ready for it.No, no, it's nothing to do with that.Well, I was telling the other psychiatrist He's  he's not a psychiatrist.Oh. He said he was a psychiatrist.Well  yes  um, he's a kind of psychiatrist             he's  he's not a proper psychiatrist. He's not er  fully             qualified  in, um, quite the sort of way we should want. Anyway             the problem I believe is basically sexual is it?I asked him that!Out please! I'm terribly sorry, sir.             We have a lot of problems here with bogus psychiatrists. One of the             risks in psychiatry I'm afraid. Unfortunately they do tend to             frighten the patient and they can cause real and permanent damage to             the treatment. But I assure you that I am a completely bona fide             psychiatrist. Here's my diploma in psychiatry from the University of             Oxford. This here shows that I'm a member of the British Psychiatric             Association, a very important body indeed. Here's a letter from             another psychiatrist in which he mentions that I'm a psychiatrist.             This is my Psychiatric Club tie, and as you can see the cufflinks             match. I've got a copy of `Psychiatry Today' in my bag, which I             think is pretty convincing. And a letter here from my mother in             which she asks how the psychiatry is going, and I think you'll             realize that the one person you can't fool is your mother. So if             you'd like to ask me any questions abut psychiatry, I bet I can             answer them.No, no, it's all right, really.There's a proper psychiatrist to see you,             Dr Rufus Berg.Right you've got the girl down on the             bed, you've got her legs up on the mantelpiece.Well, well done, Mr. Hamlet. You've done             extremely well in out disorientation tests.Oh? Oh!You see, I'm sorry it might have confused you a             little, but we do this to try to establish a very good             doctor/patient relationship, you see  we do it to sort of, as it             were, to break down the barriers. All right?yes fine.Good! Well, you've got her legs up on the             mantelpiece On behalf of the Psychiatric Association, I             should like to say that we are taking firm action to clamp down on             the activities of bogus psychiatrists. In fact in many areas of             modern psychiatry computers are now being increasingly used for the             first basic diagnosis and this has gone a long way in eliminating             the danger of unqualified impostors.Out!Good evening and welcome to `Nationwide'. The             program where we do rather wet things nationally and also give you             the chance to see some rather wet items in the Regions. Well,             everyone is talking about the Third World War which broke out this             morning. But here on `Nationwide' we're going to get away from that             a bit and look instead at the latest theory that sitting down             regularly in a comfortable chair can rest your legs. It sounds very             nice doesn't it, but can it be done? Is it possible or practical for             many of us in our jobs and with the sort of busy lives we lead to             sit down in a comfortable chair just when we want? We sent our             reporter John Dull to find out.Well, here I am on London's busy Westminster             Bridge, seeing just how much time sitting down can take. Well, I             arrived here by train at about 8.50, it's now 9.05, so I've been             here approximately twelve minutes and if it's any encouragement, I             must say that my legs do feel rested.Is this your chair?Er  well, no, it's a prop.It's been stolen!What?This belongs to a Mrs. Edgeworth of Pinner                she's standing over there.Ah well, it's nothing to do with me. It's just a             prop which the BBC  aaargh!Well er  perhaps you'd better give it back to             her.You don't believe I'm a policeman, do you?Yes I do!What am I wearing on my head?A helmetYes.Yes.That little number there?Yes.That is a Metropolitan Area Identification             Code. No helmet is authentic without that number.I see.Oh could I Hang on!Well, no I don't.Ah! Their helmets used to look like  you got             any paper?Well only these scripts.I'll have that!I say!Now then. Their helmet was not unlike the             bobby's helmet in basic shape. It had an emblem here, and three gold                and in those days it really was gold, that's part of the reason             the Tsar was so unpopular    three gold bands surmounted by a golden             eagle on the apex here. Pretty nice helmet, eh?Yes.No parked! What's that then?That's our lunch.Right. I'm taking that in for forensic             examination.Why?Now, the Chaldeans, who used to inhabit the             area in between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, their helmets were             of the modular restrained kind of type Oh Robert, tell me I'm beautiful.Oh you are, you are!Oh Robert, do you mean that?Of course I do.You're not just saying that because I asked you?Of course not.Oh Robert  Robert, are you sure it doesn't put             you off?What?My father wanting to come and live with us.No, of course I don't mind your father coming to             live with us.He wouldn't just be living with us.What do you mean?Well, he finds it very difficult to get to sleep on             his own, so I said he could sleep with us.He wants to put his bed in our room?No, no, of course not.Oh good Our bed is plenty big enough for three What?He'd just get into bed and go to sleep.No. I'm not having that.Oh Robert, I thought you loved me?Well I do, but Well, he wouldn't look.He's bound to peek.No, no, he wouldn't honestly.No! No! No!!Oh no dad, you're not.No, no.Good.Well, I think I'll get to sleep.Are you sure?Oh yes, I'm a bit tired after the wedding.Bob, what about you?Oh yes, all right, yes.Oh well, I seem to be O/C lights.Good night.Good night!Father. Father, what are you doing?I'm making a boat.What?It's the Cutty Sark. It's a model I've been making             in the dark for some years now.Well, wouldn't it be better with the light on?No, no, I'm making it in the dark, that's the             point.Oh dear, not as accurate as I thought.It's not the Cutty Sark!Shut up! Will you shut up in there!I am myself indifferent honest, but then I could             accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne             me.O fair Ophelia, nymph, in thy orisons, be all my             sins remembered So anyway, you've got the girl on the bed and her             legs are on the mantelpiece Continue on to the next sketchThat was a great fight, Champ, a great fight, you hear! Oh             boy, what a fight, Champ, what a great fight! You nearly had him,             Champ, you nearly had him  where's his head?I got it in here, Mr. Gabriello.You were great, Champ, d'you hear, you were great!OK, Mr. Gabriello.He was great, Mr. Gabriello.The way he kept fighting after his head came off!He was better when the head came off, Mr. Gabriello. He was             really dodging the guy.Yeah, I reckon that if he could've lasted till the end of that             first minute, he would've had the Killer worried.Sure, Mr. Gabriello.Oh he was great. Did you see his left arm?No!OK, we'll look around the hall after everybody's gone.Do you realize Mr. Gabriello, some of those guys out there paid             over $2,000 for a ringside seat.This your boy's head?No, no, we've got his head. He ain't hurt that bad.OK, give it to me. I'm seeing his trainer tomorrow. I'll give             it to him.Hey, Mr. Gabriello. The press is still outside. Are you ready             for them?How's the Champ?Hey Mr. Gabriello, Mr. Gabriello. Did you expect your boy to             last the full twenty eight seconds?This boy has never let me down. He's the pluckiest goddamn             fighter I've ever trained.Were you worried when his head started to come loose?No, no, we were expecting that. I told them to expect it to             and it did. He ain't stupid.Hey, can we have a word with the Champ?Yeah OK. But keep the questions simple.Hey Champ! How're you feeling?Mr. Gabriello. People are saying that the kid ought to be             buried. His head's come off in the last six fights.There's no question of burying the kid. He's just reaching the             top.Well, shouldn't he just stay in hospital?No, he ain't going to no hospital. He's got the return fight             next week.And there's Frank Sinatra leaving the ring.             Behind him is George Raft, another great boxing fan, Martin Bormann,             acknowledging the applause, and with him of course is Gus Himmler,             who did an awful lot for the sport in his country in the early             1940s. And here comes the Champ now and he seems in good shape to             meet the Killer once again. Before an audience, some of them will             have paid $920,000 million for the privilege of seeing this boy get             beaten up. And there's the bell.Quiet!!Been shopping?No,  I've been shopping.What'd you buy?What d'you buy that for?It was a bargain.I wanted to listen to that!Morning Mrs. Gorilla.Morning Mrs. Non Gorilla.Have you been shopping?No  been shopping.Did you buy anything?A piston engine!What d'you buy that for?Oooh!

Life goes on as it has done for years.But soon this quiet pattern of life was to             change irrevocably. The commonplace routine of a typical Monday             morning would never be the same again, for into this quiet little             community came Mr. Neutron!Mr. Neutron!
